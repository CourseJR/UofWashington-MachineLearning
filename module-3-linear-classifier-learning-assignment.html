The straps are long enough to get all the way up on your shoulder without falling down. The only thing I do NOT like about it is the zipper does not close the bag entirely.

It's hard to figure out how to assemble the little stands that stablize the bottom saucer.  I had to call the manufacturer for help.  The holes dont match up but I learned that's because Graco, the manufacturer, uses the same saucer on several different toys so the holes are actually for a different application.  The same little stands (or legs) don't stay clicked into place, so I've given up and we let the saucer just rock.  I did ask Graco to send another set, which they said they would do.  We're waiting for those to arrive.  In addition, our boy loves the puppet, but it's not the easiest to operate.  The hole in the back just doesnt seem to be angled right and it's hard to make your fingers fit to properly move the mouth.

I'm not a clean freak, but I've worked in that industry & not much thought goes into cleaning the chairs.First, I don't know what restaurants the other reviewers are going to, but we have not found one yet that has tables that this chair will not work on.  We've gone everywhere from McD to Outback with them without a table-fail.  We can use them at booths or normal tables (beware the booths...they give good foot-holds for the kids to stand up)  I usually put a chair slightly under the high chair, more to protect the babies' backs from passerbys than anything else.  I have no fear that this chair is going to crash to the floor.  They are so secure!!Second, the first of two problems I have found with this chair is that the chair doesn't have much support.  It really is a lot like putting the kid in a plastic bag.  So you need to insure the baby can sit up well on their own before trying to use this.  My daughter is a little small (19lbs at 19 months) and she used to be buried in the chair.  But she was so determined & excited to be sitting at the table with everyone else.The second problem is with the harness.  I have to use it, my daughter climbs on everything.  So I love that it's 5-point and not just 3-point.  But the straps get in the way every single time we put the kids in them.  Their feet get tangled up & we have to take additional time to un-tangle them.  The buckle on one of the chairs has broken but it's still functional.OH...I also recommend caring for them a little more gently than we have.  I just toss them in the stow-and-go compartments when we get back to the car.  This has resulted in one of the red release buttons to pop off.  Of course, we can't find it.

He's already over 20 pounds but can't face forward for another 5 months - so all those other car seats that only hold 40 pounds total were going to be a waste of money for us. This seat holds 80 pounds total, so this is one baby item he won't be growing out of so soon!  Parents - please remember that your baby needs to face backwards until they are at least 20 pounds AND over 1 year old!The seat itself was a breeze to put together.  It went from box to back seat in about 20 minutes.  It comes completely put together except that you have to adjust the shoulder straps to the height of your baby.  The first time we put my wiggly little guy in the seat, everything clipped together like a charm.  No pinched fingers, no digging for straps under his legs, no frustrated Mommy or Baby.The seat fits nicely with room to spare in our mini-suv.  We could even move the passenger seat back a little from where the seat had to be for the baby car seat we just replaced.  And speaking of - this car seat IS NOT for newborn babies.  If you are buying your baby's first car seat - buy a baby seat.  These convertible car seats are for infants and toddlers NOT little babies - and once you start shopping around for anything from toys to books to clothes you will know there is a big difference between babies and infants.This chair sits up straighter than a baby seat.  My little boy was tired of laying down in his baby seat by the time he hit the 20 pound limit, so the new sitting position in this seat is much better.  However, if your child can't hold their own head up or tip up their own bottle or sippy cup, they won't be able to give themselves a drink. Speaking of - the entire top cover comes off EASILY and you can throw it in the washing machine!  With or without mashed-in bananas and cheerios and milk!Also - when your little one does fall asleep in this chair - have a pillow or a rolled up blanket to catch their necks.  Their heads will tilt down if you don't. That's gravity's fault - not the chair's.Basically, if you have a little one who likes to sit up and look out the window or amuse themselves in the back seat - this car seat is perfect.

The front (closest to the child) is the only part that snaps on, so all they have to do is reach over and grab the opposing side and then the whole thing comes off!  But this is a pretty minor inconvenience - the rest of the tray is very easy to clean.

I don't know, but it's simple. Once you have plugged it in, you hit the ON button, then one of the bottle size buttons (I personally always use the 8oz size regardless), then pres ON *again*. If it doesn't work, pull it out and put it back in - it may not have connected right with your car. You should feel it get warm within 15-30 seconds.*Of course it can create a hot spot in your milk, that's why you give it a shake before you give it to your baby. Any method of heating can do that*If it melts your bottle, you are leaving your bottle in WAY too long. 10 minutes max!Obviously this will not work with drop-in liner bottles because the milk needs to be touching the side of the bottle for the warmth to transfer. HOWEVER, I used these bottles with my first son and all I did was bring a regular bottle along in the car that I would pour the water/milk into, then heat that bottle and simply pour the heated milk into our drop-in liner bottle.

Tragically, while these children are mechanically inclined, they are not intelligent enough to resist the urge to pursue dangerous escapes.The second group is too unintelligent or impatient (as adults) to handle the exact same latching mechanism, or to step over a small bar. Hence they break the handle, and trip over the small lower anchor bar. This is tragic for both the parents and the children for so many reasons.The third group is deceived by the admittedly ambiguous instructions. You need to have this gate in a door frame or spanning between against two strong vertical surfaces. Then you need to crank the heck out of the compression \"bolts\"  to ensure a very high degree of pressure. If you try to put it up against drywall, you will poke through the drywall. If you do not make the gate VERY tightly lodged, it will fall over, probably on your child as they try to climb on it.So, there are some legitimate problems with the gate. But, installed correctly and in a house of moderate intelligence on both the adult and child front, it should be just fine.I am of moderate intelligence, as are my offspring, and we have managed to make it work in three separate houses with only minor annoyance.YMMV.Update: Customer service was very responsive and nice when I needed to get a few replacement parts that got lost in a recent move.": {"frequency": 1, "value": "After reading the ..."}, "Unlike several of the other reviewers, I really like this stroller!

I could never sleep for some reason.  I got the pillow and fell in love with it.  I'm now 27 weeks pregnant and couldn't live without it.  As far as the review where the seam digs into the neck and shoulders, occasionally if i push myself too far up into the pillow this happens... so i readjust and i'm fine.  I love that it goes around both sides of the pillow.  I'm notorious for waking up in the middle of the night on my back (in tremendous pain), so i tuck the side of the pillow on my back under my back snugly and so if i happen to roll over at night it won't allow me to be flat on my back I'm at an angle (which is better for baby and me).  I think the only downfall for the pillow was the cover.  When i ordered mine there was not a replacement cover, so i take it off and wash it.  The cover now has those little beaded balls on it which aren't the most comfortable.  I bought 3 1/2 yards of fabric and made myself a new cover and whalah everything is good.

They provided me with a deluxe electric double pump which worked well.  I was told my supply couldn't be established/maintained with my manual pump at home, so I went home with a hospital rental while my baby stayed in the hospital.  When it was time for him to come home, I contemplated whether or not to keep renting the electric pump; I had received this ISIS pump as a shower gift and I thought I'd try it before deciding what to do.  Well, I was shocked how well this pump worked.  It is so comfortable to use and doesn't tire your hand pumping.  In the same time it took me to double pump (15 minutes) I got the same amount of milk using the manual one breast at a time!  I ended up returning the electric pump and didn't at all feel uneasy about maintaining milk supply.  This pump works as well, if not better than the electric pump and costs so much less!!  This is my 4th child, I've tried other manual pumps as well as battery operated ones in the past, but none compare to this pump.  My only qualm about this system is that the nipple rings and nipples for feeding are substantially bigger than the standard nipples/size for bottles, so you are committed to using only their brand with their bottles (the bottles are nicely shaped and easy to hold).  My baby had a hard time breast feeding, so we had to bottle feed for a while and he couldn't get the hang of their bottle nipple so I had to pour off my milk into another type of bottle system to feed him.": {"frequency": 1, "value": "My baby was in the ..."}, "My mom bought one of these to take the place of a high chair when we had 2 8-9 month olds and a 3 year old at her house for christmas.

I have used ours for our 1 yr old every single time we go to a restaurant, ever since he got sick in Feb with a very painful virus which the doctor said one could catch in any public place.  I've never been a panicky mom about cooties, but that was my limit.  With this chair, I can comfortable seat him at any restaurant and know he is safe and can both sit ina clean seat and eat his food off a clean tray.  I love that all parts of the tray go conveniently in the DW.  My son can be impatient, too, and both the seatbelt and the tray snapping on over his lap help keep him comfortably restrained. Not only do we use it for the little one in restaurants, but we use it for our almost-4 yr old to raise him to a comfortable height at our dining room table.  They are both big boys (90-95% in size), but both the 1 and 4 yr old fit comfortably.  It folds small enough that I can tuck it into my stroller basket to have on hand, and everyone loves how it all folds into a small package, with a convenient handle for carryign it.

Since it is made for close contact/play, it makes sense that this product wouldn't be so loud that I could hear it a mile away. And to be honest, the sound quality really isn't bad at all for what it is.This toy is very colorful and my son (who is only just turning 4 months old), while not really interested in toys yet, holds a fascination for listening to this thing make its noises. If I put it at his feet, he will kick it just to make it turn on. He really seems to enjoy it, even if he doesn't have quite enough strength yet to really push the buttons on his own. The construction seems pretty solid (I would almost be afraid that my kid could brain himself with this item if he were strong enough to pick it up) and it came included with batteries already installed.Children have the option of pushing one side of the cube to listen to it or adding in the sounds from other sides to create a cacophony of sound. There is also, of course, the orchestra button. If you push the button twice, it turns that particular instrument off so you can hear the other instruments. It lights up but I kind of wish it lit up more as you can barely see it in well-lit rooms.About the only complaint I really have is that some of the instruments don't sound anything like what the represented instrument should sound like. The violin for example sounds suspiciously like an oboe and the piano sounds remarkably like a harpsichord. However, I am not so elitist that I wouldn't let my kid play with this because the sounds are different than what I would expect them to be. I realize that most people cannot discern the differences in the sounds of like instruments in most cases unless they have had a background in music education, so it's really not a big deal. If he enjoys it, then that is ultimately what matters.However, I am giving this product 4 out of 5 stars because of this discrepancy as well as the fact that the French horn (while also sounding off) sounds really, really weak compared to the other instruments on the cube. The other instruments seem very clear and concise and yet, I can barely hear the French horn.But, my son seems to enjoy it so far (and as I mentioned, he doesn't seem to care much for toys yet) and to me, that is worth the money in the end.": {"frequency": 1, "value": "I'm really not ..."}, "I got this for my wife who is pregnant with twins and she loves this thing.

Obviously, it is expensive, but not much more than the ones that match bedding, which are generally pastel colors and although very cute, not very captivating. There is great contrast on each animal and there are parts that slide up and down on the bars of the mobile that capture my baby's attention. I can count on her being drawn to this for the 15 minutes it plays. I will be really sad when she can start grabbing it and I have to put the mobile away.However, after a little over 3 months, it stopped working. I had the original receipt, but not the box, so BRU exchanged it for the exact same mobile and kept the box so they could send the broken one back. The second one worked for about 5 minutes and the music sounded really bad, Needless to say, I was very sad and upset because my baby loves it and it was a very costly item that I want to use with future kids. After this trouble, I checked these reviews and realized the problem was not unique.THE GOOD NEWS, I called Tiny Love Customer service (1-888-Tiny-Love) just before Christmas and told them the problem. They said they have had several of the same complaints and they have fixed the motor in the music box. They asked me for a number on the unit and sent me a new music box. I received it just after Christmas, no more than a week after calling them. I was VERY impressed. I read a couple reviews that mentioned that the customer service was really bad, but I did not have that experience. The new one has worked fine so far (1 month later) and the music is nice like the first one purchased. (I also just noticed that you can fill out a form online to get a replacement part.)A couple of negative things.1. The remote is useless. You have to set the remote setting on the music box itself to get the remote to work...what's the point?2. It would be nice if the music and mobile were independent of each other. I have the Kick and Play piano (which she loves) under the mobile so as she gets excited by the mobile, she starts kicking the piano, however, as you can imagine, the music from the mobile overlapping the music from the kick and play piano is quite unnerving :-)UPDATE 9 years later: I just came across this review I wrote.

It is a decent choice for us; however, there are a couple of difficulties we've experienced with this seat.The first problem is that, at times, the tray doesn't snap on easily. One side will snap easily, then the other side can be difficult. With a squirmy or fussy baby, this can be frustrating. Not sure if it's a defect with our seat or if others have experienced this too. Luckily, after multiple attempts with position changes, it snaps and is very secure.Also, being slightly above average in height (6' and 5'7) and owning a standard-sized kitchen table and chairs, the booster seat sits so low that we have to slouch to feed the baby, or build up the base to raise the height for comfort. Neither are great options, so beware to taller parents!Besides these two issues, we find this seat a good value. It keeps the baby safe and secure, seems comfortable for the baby, is very easy to wipe down, is easily transportable to use at Grandma's house or at restaurants, and comes with dishwasher-safe divider tray with a cover. Also, for those of you without a lot of space or who just don't want a huge high chair sitting around, the booster chair slides easily under our table (while secured to the chair) when not being used.

Who would've thought you could get everything you needed at such great quality at such a low price?  Our little one just started scooting across the room rapidly, so we figured it was time to get a gate to keep him out of the kitchen.  I had a coupon from Babies R Us for 10% off baby gates (priced $25 or more), so we went in and took a look at the selection, which was pretty good, actually.  Gates ranged in price from around $20 - over $70, which seems like a wide range.  We were hoping to stay at the low end, so we ruled out several right away.  I was worried about the toeholds on the diamond or square metal mesh of the really cheap gates in case our baby turns out to be a climber.  But the things that we saw in the more expensive gates (solid panel, ability to swing on a hinge, etc.) were all in this gate!  Not to mention the fact that you could also use it without the hinge, and it had the ability to be used on uneven door frames.  We had the intention of putting it up on a hinge because of the inconvenience of taking it out and putting it back all the time, but tried it without and discovered it's so easy, we don't even really NEED to mount it to the doorframe!  For anybody worried about the strength of unmounted gates, I honestly wasn't expecting it to hold so firmly!  You put it in and expand it to fit the opening tightly, then push down on the handle to lock in place, which  tightens it even further.  All these pros and I can see no cons so far!

In that case, we have the gate configured in a 90 degree angle, and it works equally well.As for operation, it is easily opened with one hand (while carrying your little one) and yet secure enough that our 13-month-old has yet to figure out how to do so himself.  When open, the doors stay open without swinging shut automatically, good for people who have pets and want them to be able to roam freely when the baby isn't home or is asleep in his crib.

It is also one of the only brands of slings available in stores, at least in my area, but it is relatively cheap at $29 (compared to $30 and up for some other brands) and you can return it easily if it doesn't work for you. Advantages: The sling allows you to carry your baby in a zillion positions.  You can, with practice, breastfeed very discreetly with the sling. (I marched in a parade while breastfeeding my four-week-old in this sling!) The padded rails are great for a novice slinger with a newborn because you can arrange the fabric &amp; rails to give the baby's head a lot of support.  Drawbacks: The sling is difficult to adjust to a very small-framed person because of the amount of fabric and the padded rails. The padding also makes the sling bulky.  The fabric is not very attractive (if you look at your sling as an accessory).  The sling might be too warm for people in hot climates.A note on slinging:Even though this might not be the BEST sling out there, slings in general are a fabulous way to enjoy life with baby. Wearing your baby throughout part or all of the day will allow you to do housework, go on walks, enjoy outings, etc., while interacting and bonding with your child. Sling babies are more organized, calmer, and cry less than infants who are put in cribs or plastic buckets (carriers) all the time. They spend more time in the quiet alert state and absorb all of the amazing sights and sounds of Mom or Dad's world. If you have never used a sling before, this one's relatively low cost makes it worth trying. If you're a practiced babywearer, I would consider another brand that is tailored more for your particular size &amp; shape.

We immediately returned both and replaced them with simple muslin sheets that are much more effective for swaddling (not to mention less expensive) and if he gets one over his face they are breathable so there is no issue.May this be a warning to other parents, this product seems like a good idea but it is potentially dangerous for active babies that like to move their arms a lot and is not nearly as good as simple breathable swaddling blankets.

Finally, I feel better for him. A happy baby makes for a happy me. My baby was not latching well to the Avent nipples - not a bad product, but the gap between his lips and the Avent's firm silicone nipple caused milk to drip down his chin every time he feeds, the same gaps allows air to sip through and get ingested by him - and as a result, he experiences gas pain after almost every feeding. If your baby can latch onto the Avent nipple properly, then he should have no problems with it. The Avent still offers the most complete bottle-feeding system on the market today.

I barely feel this and have far greater control over the speed of the suction. With no need to adjust the suction strength itself, this pump is so easy to use.At first I was afraid nothing was happening; then I realized that I needed to push the pump into the breast a bit to make the soft horn work.

But in reading some reviews on it, some people said it leaked....well back to the store that went (unopened).  I kept this one because I liked the idea of the sling for a newborn and I liked the fact that it has the stopper that is supposed to change color if the water is too hot.  Well my daughter hated taking a bath in the sling.  Each time I put her in it, she looked terrified as if she was going to fall out of it.  Eventually, she started to hang a leg off the sling as if to brace herself (it was kinda funny to see her doing that :).  But I finally decided, enough is enough and started giving her baths without the sling and she now likes to take a bath.  I like the padding for her back and the contoured floor so she won't slip.  Now, I think she really looks forward to taking a bath.  Also, because of my odd shaped kitchen sink, the tub wouldn't fit into it, so I just set this tub up in her room on her changing table with a towel under it.  It works out really great.

Having a video monitor is great because you can check if the baby's awake or just squawking in his sleep before you go all the way in there.  I've tried three: this one, the Mobi Cam, and the new Safety First version.  Both the other two got constant static that caused the picture to flicker and a clicking sound to come through on the audio.  This one is USUALLY static free, accept for a periodic BLARE, usually in the middle of the night. It's pretty frustating, but I've now found a low enough volume level whereby the static won't scare me out of bed when it hits but I can still hear if my son cries.As for the other features, the \"color\" is pretty poor, but the night vision works fairly well.  It's very nice that it's portable, and that you don't HAVE to mount the camera--you can place it on a flat surface and angle it to see.  I also like that when it's unplugged, the video shuts off after a couple minutes so it doesn't drain your battery.  Then you can pop it back on (or off) with the touch of a big button on top.  When it's plugged in, the video will stay on all night, but I feel like it starts to get warm when I leave the picture on too long.  I generally shut it off until he makes noise, then I turn on the picture to see what's going on down there.Since I've tried THREE video monitors, and this worked the best in my house, I thought I'd pass the research along.": {"frequency": 1, "value": "I definitely ..."}, "I have the old model Diaper Genie and am sooo glad to have one!  A few comments:1. Some people claim the refills are too expensive. We get them at WalMart for less than $5 each and each one has lasted more than a month, even with a 7-month-old who poops like it's an Olympic sport. $5 a month is worth it for the convience of not having to change it as much as you would with a garbage bag - which are probably about as expensive.2. Some people say it smells - I can't believe that.  Even with our baby eating solid foods and making hideously stinky poops, there is NO odor in our nursery.  Not even a little!!  I empty it every 7-10 days and there is never, ever an odor coming from it, even when I am sitting next to it playing on the floor with the baby. UPDATE: We switched to the Toddler strength or Stage 2 refills at about 9 months as he started to eat more \"real\" food - still no odors!I love that the Genie is easy to use, easy to empty and refill and that there is no smell at all.

Others have said that this is a \"luxury item\", but I disagree.  Spending $20 on something that you'll use for years to make diaper changes more comfortable for the baby isn't a \"luxury\" to me.  Does your baby need this to survive, of course not...  but isn't it our job to make our little ones as happy and comfortable as possible?I have read the negative reviews some people have written on this warmer and I have to say - READ THE DIRECTIONS PEOPLE!The Ever-Fresh pillow is not supposed to keep the wipes moist for 3 months without re-wetting it.  The directions clearly state \"Add water as necessary.  Do not allow Ever-Fresh to dry out.\"  This is not difficult, we just re-wet the pad every time we refill the warmer (about once a week).  You are supposed to replace the pad every 3 months (for best results), but we have not replaced it that often.  We replace the pad when it starts loosing its softness and it stays a little brown after re-wetting.As far as people complaining that the wipes are \"freezing cold\" by the time they get to the baby - they must live at the North Pole.  Yes, the wipes will cool down a little once you remove them from the warmer (simple physics people), but they are nowhere near being cold.  This warmer really does make a difference in the wipe temperature.  We travel frequently and my son always \"protests\" when unwarmed wipes touch his bottom (he tries to pull away and says \"cold\").  He never does this at home with the warm wipes.  I have tried warming the wipes with my hands, but that doesn't seem to do anything at all.  We are going to be spending a lot of time up North this winter, so we are buying another warmer for Grandma's house.We use Huggies \"reach-in\" wipes and they work great.  I haven't tried the \"pop-up\" wipes so I can't comment on those.  We use `reach-in' so I can buy the big box of replacement wipes and use it to refill the wipe warmer and the travel wipe cases.Hope this information helps you!": {"frequency": 1, "value": "We have been using ..."}, "Bought this and had it sent to my granddaughter for the baby.

CHANGE BAGS FREQUENTLY!!  I change mine about 1 or 2 times a week.  For those who complain that the pail gets stuck, that is probably a good indication that the BAG IS GETTING TOO FULL!! Also, making sure that the tape on the diapers is secure will prevent that from happening as well.2. YOU STILL HAVE TO CLEAN THE THING!!  Hello, it does house dirty diapers!! All I do is wipe it down with some antibacterial wipes (takes about 10 seconds!!) and then maybe spray some Lysol in it and let it air out for a minute or two.  SIMPLE AND IT WORKS!Also, for those that complain that the Diaper Champ isn't as effective as time passes, keep the following in mind:AS BABIES GET OLDER, THEIR DIETS CHANGES (aka SOLID FOODS!) AND SO DOES THE SMELL OF THEIR DIAPERS!In talking with other parents, I get the same feedback - as babies get older and become toddlers, ALL DIAPER PAILS become gradually less and less effective until they are just no longer useful.

I feel that the padding itself is pretty cushiony (especially if compared to the expandable table guards) and I feel it would prevent a child from seriously hurting themselves if they should run into the table. However, I also felt there were a few problems.  You have to apply the four pre-cut foam corners to the table (easy), then you have to measure the rest of the foam, which is one long piece, to fit your table--and you have to be EXACT so USE A TAPE MEASURER (easy). However, cutting the foam was NOT that easy. The directions suggest you use a serrated bread knife - we opted to use a razor knife - but still ended up with some gaps. This certainly does NOT look good and cannot be fixed! The tape they give you to apply to the table is NOT very durable and I don't see it lasting. I don't know how easy the tape itself comes off the table, but I do know that the foam is constantly coming off of the tape. Plus small children, like mine, are forever pulling the foam off of the table - which IS very easy for them to do. My children are always playing near the table now since they enjoy pulling the foam off so much! Another dissapointment is that the foam only protects the top and sides of the corners - whereas I would have prefered it covered the ENTIRE corner (top and bottom) in case a child is reaching under the table and hits his/her head while standing up. Also, if anything gets spilled onto the table - which DOES happen with kids - it will lessen the durability of the tape. And you WILL get crumbs in between the table and the foam - which IS very hard to clean. Overall, the product is good and does serve its purpose.  I will definately keep the foam on my table since I feel it will help to prevent any serious injuries, but I am going to also be ordering one of the \"expandable\" bumbers to cover it.

I would never leave her in the co-sleeper unattended now that she is mobile because she could easily fall out of it .... or crawl onto my bed and fall off of that.

So I went to a discount store and bought a firm twin-sized memory foam mattress for $20 and literally \"cut\" it down to fit inside the co-sleeper.  I placed the memory foam mattress on top of the flimsy one it comes with.

It was as comfortable as you can reasonably expect a backpack holding a 22lbs child can be and was easy to use.  We spent a couple minutes figuring out the sun shade/canopy but once understood, we had no trouble. It's great for hiking and/or taking your child someplace where a stroller is difficult to maneuver.  It has pockets and a drink holder that are very handy.  My only fear while wearing it is that if I turn my ankle or something, then the big boy and I are both going down... but otherwise it seems very safe for him and me.I do notice that after he's been in the pack more than 30 minutes he gets a bit of a red mark on the insides of his legs if his bare leg touches on that part.  It doesn't appear to chafe him or anything... more of a pressure mark.  He's has chubby legs and the inside cradle for the child seems to be kinda wide in the crotch area (probably for support reasons) but it seems a bit too wide for him.  I try to make sure and put a little towel or cloth down there if he's going to be in it for awhile.  It totally doesn't seem to bother him at all (he loves being in the pack) but it does look red when I get him out of the pack.I would suggest starting out slowly and not going on a 45 minute walk the first time out (which I did because my son seemed to enjoy it so much!) because it can be a little tiring for your back the first time.  I was not in pain or anything (was in PAIN when I used the Baby Bjorn as soon as big boy hit the 18 pound-ish mark)but the area between my shoulder blades started to feel tired.  I also notice that I tend to slump or lean forward a little when I wear it.  My husband doesn't seem to do this though... could be because he's taller and the pack doesn't hit his bottom or could be due to the fact that women's center of gravity is in the caboose while men's center of gravity is in the shoulders (also noticable when women are learning to ice skate... they tend to stick out the booty more than men!).  My friend has the same backpack and said that she stopped leaning forward after she got more used to the pack so I think it's something that you stop doing once you're used to carrying that much weight on your back.Anyway, all in all I was very pleased with the cost and functionality of the pack.

My younger daughter is 7 weeks old and she eats 4 oz per feeding and looks like she could eat more if only the bottle would hold more...I would recommend getting a set of 3 9-oz Dr. Brown's bottles as it looks like a better value and will serve you longer (you can pour as little milk or formula in a 9 oz bottle as you need, while 4 oz bottles will only hold 4 oz max, and will be useless in a couple of months at the latest).": {"frequency": 2, "value": "I am a ..."}, "So happy we decided to get this sleep sack.

My husband complains about how little space he has, but he does that even when it's not on the bed so I ignore him. The only thing I hate about this thing (yes hate!) is that the pillowcase is a complete pain in the butt to put back on once you have washed it! If they made it with a zipper instead of a regular style case this would be perfect. Oh,the seam along the curve of the U is kinda painful on your neck and shoulders when you use it next to your head instead of at you feet but bunching a sheet or regular pillowcase along it completely solves that problem.

I am so glad I bit the bullet on this and got it. We almost didn't due to it being $40 for a pillow but it is way worth the cost even if your on a tight budget.

She was mildly interested. Our younger one, now 2 years old, loves it so it really depends on the child.It is light and portable, which makes it incredibly handy.We use our twilight turtle often for both children in our night time ritual, when we travel to create a secure feeling away from home and an instant home-like atmosphere at bed-time, in the car at night on road trips to calm fussy little ones where the light is not too distracting but creates an instant dreamy interior to the car. We have just simply played with it for fun during the day in dimly lit spots and even used it when the power goes out to find our way and create calming light for our disconcerted children. I even use myself sometimes to check on the kids at night and to find my way.The three color choices are great. The brightest seems to green, then blue is medium brightness and gold the dimmest. None of them are super bright but we have never had trouble seeing any of them. When the batteries weaken the lights start to fade but will perk up again when changed.Interestingly, everyone has a definite favorite starlight color in the family, so it allows a choice at bed time. I think we all come to find that giving choices or power where we can is a good thing!I had originally meant to buy the blue sea turtle because I imagined the brown one would be too dull.

After initial frustration when I first bought the brackets I ran down to the home improvement store and picked up a package of small screws and used those instead, and drilled lead holes, and have had no problems.As far as holes in your furniture are concerned, I figure it's a small price to pay for safety. We've also used these straps to loop around items so we don't have to drill into them, with great success.Personally, I do NOT use these brackets on anything truly heavy. They're great for smaller items, particularly those you might need to move from time to time to clean underneath, vacuum under, etc.  The brackets are hard enough to get off that my children have never been able to remove them, but easy enough that I don't avoid moving our nightstands, toy organizers, dollhouse, etc. in order to get the area nice and clean.If you're looking to secure something mid-weight, I highly recommend the KidCo furniture straps. For heavyweight items I love using the Quakehold! furniture straps (which don't have to be screwed into your furniture, but can be if you prefer).Growing up in SoCal and living through several big earthquakes and as a mother of three children (one of which seems to be part monkey) I've found that there's no single product that is going to secure everything in your house, but I definitely keep these brackets around as part of my furniture securing \"kit\".": {"frequency": 1, "value": "We are on our ..."}, "My son (6 years old) plays with this all of the time!

She loved her previous experience with the product, and we are glad that she spoke up to recommend it to us.Pluses: It is a LOT easier to use than the Diaper Genie (for example you can throw a diaper away with just one hand!  Woo-hoo!)  Also, you can use regular kitchen trash bags inside it, so you don't have to buy special bags at an inflated price.  Further, due to it's extra large containment area you don't have to take out the trash as often as you would have to with the smaller Diaper Genie and the smell seems to stay inside just fine. :)The one minus that I experienced: According to the directions that came in the box, you can take apart the drum/piston assembly if you should wish to thoroughly clean the inside of it.  When we first bought the Diaper Genie I tried to take it apart.  I *could not* get it to come apart, nor could my husband.  It would not BUDGE-so much so that if the directions didn't specifically mention that it could be separated I would have assumed that it was not built to come apart.  After trying to get it apart for a ridiculous amount of time, (using practically everything from my nails to a crowbar,) I finally broke down and called the customer service number to see if I was missing some key- a button or lever to push- anything!  The customer service person told me to \"try harder\", then call again if I couldn't get it open!(Insert long pause with upraised eyebrows here.)Needless to say, I thought that was a bit less than helpful.  So... maybe my Diaper Genie was warped, or maybe they are all impossible to get open- it's your gamble.  I didn't take it back to the store because I assume that they are all that way.

With the Nojo, you really can adjust everything - where you put them, how you put it on, how high or low you wear it, etc.There are two excellent uses that I found for the sling, but DIDN'T like the Baby Bjorn for:1) At night when the baby is very young (up to about 4 months), you can \"wear the baby down\" in the sling by walking around till the baby falls asleep.  It's a great way to calm/ quiet and get the baby to sleep.  It used to work when even rocking wouldn't work.2) You can literally do the dishes, laundry, even have a snack while wearing the sling.  This was somehow a lot harder for me with the Bjorn because I kept bumping the baby.Don't get me wrong, I love the Bjorn too and find it much better for walks.

Suffice it to say that this process will cause you to miss all of the trailers and the first ten minutes of the movie.

In addition, if your car's seat belts need to retract fully before they will feed out again, there will also be trial and error.  One of the tricks is to ensure the lap part of the belt is cinched down tightly at the buckle, while you have applied enough pressure (body weight) into the seat to ensure the seat does not rock side-to-side.  Mighty Tite makes this process a breeze!  Just play the belt through the seat as normal, cinch the lap belt to the buckle to remove excessive play, and then crank up ol' Mighty Tite to torque down the seat.

I guess we'll be using it for a few more years since we've just added another little one to our family. I like that it allows wipes to come out one by one, always bringing the corner of the next wipe out for the next use. So the next wipe is always very easy to pull out. No digging around for a wipe. The replacement pads need to be moistened each week, in my experience. I simply hold the warmer under the faucet and pour water into it down the side. The pad soaks up the water and thus keeps all the wipes moist. I've had to replace the pad about every 2 months or so and sometimes haven't remembered to do so, or have forgotten to add water. Then it gets a bit brown, but I've just removed the lower few wipes when I threw the used pad out and continued. The pads are a little pricey, though.

I like that it is higher off the ground, so I don't have to bend over as far to put my baby in it.

Unfortunately, I made the decision to purchase one way too late.  I only got mine last week when I was 36 weeks pregnant(!!), but if I had bought one sooner, I would have saved myself many sleepless, uncomfortable nights and naps.Like other people, I had been skeptical about buying an $18 wedge for my pregnant belly when I already had a body pillow and several other pillows to provide support.  It didn't seem practical, but as the weeks wore on during my third trimester, it became abundantly clear that pillows either don't give enough support and faltered beneath the weight of my belly, or were too firm and lifted my tummy uncomfortably to the point where it seemed that my baby was being smashed back on to me.This Boppy wedge provides the perfect amount of support, and adjusting it is simply a matter of bringing it further or closer to you.  Another great thing about it is that it is not overly large, so it isn't cumbersome to sleep with.  I completely forget that it's there after I've gotten myself comfortable with it!  In addition, it doesn't absorb your body heat like other pillows do, so it never gets uncomfortably warm.Finally, you might wondering what you're going to do with it after you give birth to your baby.  Well, the pillow can be used as a back support or a wedge to place between your knees while you're sleeping to preserve hip alignment.  And if you don't want to use it for these other things, then just keep it in storage for your next pregnancy!I'm actually so incredibly sold on this product that I plan on purchasing them for other first-time pregnant women as baby shower gifts.This is a good investment for your and your baby's comfort, and your sanity as well!": {"frequency": 1, "value": "This pregnancy ..."}, "This pillow has given me the best sleep I've had in four months!!!

They turned to scabs and then when the scabs got soft in the shower, they came off leaving gaping holes in my nipples.  I fully understood the words &#34;nipple trauma.&#34;  I was using silicone nipple covers which helped my sore nipples from sticking to my bra, but I didn't feel like they were getting any air circulation..  The soft shells gave me the air circulation and allowed the Lanolin to stay on (not rub off), which I think helped me heal.The other huge benefit of the soft shells for me was to catch leaking milk.  In the beginning of nursing, I had an abundance of milk.  The breast I wasn't nursing would leak at least an ounce on let down.  I often filled the entire soft shell and it leaked out of the holes at the top.  I started putting the silicone covers over the holes so the milk wouldn't leak out during let down and then I could go empty it in the sink.  I had previously been stuffing a burp cloth in my bra, but everything still got soaked.As other reviewers stated, when I wasn't nursing, I found the soft shells did put some pressure and caused me to leak slightly.  When you bend over to pick up your baby (or something else) the milk leaks out of the holes at the top, which can be frustrating.After breastfeeding was established, and my let down wasn't so strong, I learned to apply pressure to my breast on the side I wasn't nursing during let down (pushing with the palm of my hand slightly in and upward) and this kept that side from leaking and losing that milk.I used the soft shells for several weeks and overall, I felt they were helpful in letting me heal, protecting my nipples from sticking to my bra and allowing Lanolin or other topical cream to stay on longer, the shape of the shells were decent and could be hidden under a baggy shirt, and it was great for catching excess milk.": {"frequency": 1, "value": "When I brought my ..."}, "Baby gate was bought for doorway from living room to kitchen ... good and sturdy for the price. installation only took a few minutes and hardware was used. very happy and will be ordering another one for the babies door way this week": {"frequency": 1, "value": "Baby gate was ..."}, "Our home is small and we wanted something that wouldn't take up a lot of space.

The baby really has to suck to get it out, and it has to open its mouth wider due to the size of the nipple.Feeding my son with a stage 1 nipple took a REALLY long time.  Approximately 40-45 minutes.  However, I tried a Stage 2 nipple when he was about four months old, and the milk flowed out pretty easily.  So quickly in fact that he got really mad and refused to eat because he was getting choked.  I switched back to Stage 1 nipples, and also began relying heavily on the regular Ventaire bottles.  He is now 5 months old and we have switched to Stage 2 nipples in the Natural Shape bottles, and he is doing well.  He tends to finish a 6-7 oz bottle in about 10 minutes.  These bottles are a lot wider than regular bottles, and he has a harder time trying to grasp and hold these bottles.REGULAR VENTAIRENow for the regular Ventaire bottles.  I found these bottles to be the better of the two for us.  Although I had initially breastfed, and chose the Natural Shape bottles for that reason, I had to quit breastfeeding at four weeks.  So the issue of having a nipple that wouldn't confuse the baby was no longer a concern for us.The regular Ventaire bottles had no flow issues, even with Stage 1 nipples.  He finished his bottle faster with this type of bottle and seemed to have no problems with the speed of the flow.  We switched to Stage 2 nipples a couple of weeks ago and the transition was smooth.  I didn't notice him getting choked, and he doesn't have to gulp as quickly as he does with the Stage 2 nipples on the Natural Shape bottles.  These bottles are also slimmer, which makes it easier for him to try and grasp and hold the bottle.Now for the operation of both types of bottles.  They have a plastic disc that fits into the bottom ring of the bottle, then the bottle screws on, and finally the nipple in its ring screw on top of that.  On the regular Ventaire bottles the disc fits snugly into the bottom.  On the Natural Shape bottles, it has to fit into a little notch, and it is easy to think it's in right only to find out that its not (ie, when the milk starts leaking out).We heat our bottles in a pan of water on the stove, and the bottom rings have a tendency to hold water.  So if you use this method, you need to tap the bottle sideways on the pan to shake out the water in the ring, and I usually hold a dish towel up to the edge of the ring as well and tip the bottle so that all the hot water comes out.  If you don't, when you tip the bottle to feed your baby the hot water will run down onto your hand (or the baby's hand if s/he can hold the bottle).  This isn't really a reason not to buy the bottles, just something to be aware of.Finally, some people have wondered if babies swallow less air with this type of bottle.  I have two older children that I used standard bottles with, and I have seen no difference between those and these Playtex bottles.  My son still burps just as much as the next baby.  Occasionally during feeding you can hear some air leaking out, but overall, I really don't think it makes any difference.": {"frequency": 1, "value": "When I registered ..."}, "I purchased this potty after reading Diaper Free Baby.

We toss the cups as soon as this becomes noticeable, but a slight design change to eliminate the space would be welcome to those of us who are hand washing.These cups certainly fulfill their mission and I am very happy we have them, I just wish we could get a little more mileage out of them before tossing (since every little bit helps - replacing frequently is somewhat expensive!).": {"frequency": 1, "value": "We are on our ..."}, "Bought two of these for twin grand babies.

The whole playtex line is nice.

I've washed them in the dishwasher and in the sink.  I've had no problems.  In fact, my FAVORITE part about these bottles... with dr brown's you need 4 hands at night.  I feed upstairs where surfaces I'm working with consist of the bed, nightstand and crib.  I prefill 3 bottles with water and use a separated container for the formula.  If I use the dr. brown's, you have to unscrew the nipple, pull out the tube assembly, hold them while you attempt to dump the formula in.  and where's my screaming baby during all this?  Usually in my arms or lap.  I've dumped formula all over my sheets, spilled the water on my mattress, etc.  These bottles have the same number of parts total (to wash) but they're soooo much easier!  You just unscrew it like the regular bottle and go!To be honest, I can't say that there is a huge difference in my baby's gas or burping with these bottles versus the dr. brown's.

The edges of the bubble seem like they could easily scratch a small child.We havent had any issues with the bubble water \"fogging\" or greying up, but I assume a small drop of bleach in the bubble would keep it clean.So far it has been pretty durable as we frequently roll it up(with the bubble inside) to store and transport it.

This is a great gate.  We've had it over a year and its still going strong.When looking for a gate with baby #2, we wanted something our older one could open but the little one could not.  Now, this one has a foot pedal you have to push down on, and also push open the gate at the same time.  Its tricky for kids.  My 3 yr old neice couldn't do it, but my 4 1/2 yr old got it down pat with a few days of practice.  It holds up really well - she has to jump up and down on it and push the gate at the same time before it will open - it requires enough pressure to open where a younger child wouldn't be able to open it. (And if she just stands on the foot pedal, it doesn't move.  It needs more force).I love that its hands-free, just step down and use your knee to push it open. Its swings either way, and I love that it will stand open and not auto-close.  Sometimes you don't want it closed! It is sturdy - it stands up to being slammed 10 times a day by the older one and several more by me, plus being shaken by the toddler, PLUS the 40 lb puppy running into it and trying to push it open at least 4 times a day.I have found only 2 small complaints - 1) We have had to adjust it a couple times when the locking mechanism gets offset.  Honestly, I am pretty sure that is due to my older one slamming it in the same direction every time.  Its a quick adjustment with the plastic wrench and voila!  2) While it has not yet happened, I am concerned the knee knocker feature I love so much will become a place for the toddler to put his foot and try to climb over.  Of course, he won't be able to actually get over it, and really if a toddler is climbing that much any gate will be a problem. :)A few people have complained the swing-thru gate opening is smaller than other gates.

I had to cold wash it with regular detergent, and tumble dry it slightly to the point where it would air dry the rest.  Without doing that - regular air dry out of the package wasn't doing anything for the stench.  It literally overwhelmed my room with the odor.  Word to the wise - Give yourself a good afternoon to put this together.  It took me 2.5 hours to assemble, and following the directions was not that difficult.

I was trying to decide between a Medela Pump-in-Style and the Avent Isis iQ Duo. Almost all the reviews for the Medela were very positive and my cousin and sister-in-law had used it and liked it. I found a lot of positive reviews for the Avent as well so I had a hard time deciding. I spoke with a pump specialist (he and his wife own a lactation store specializing in bras and pumps and other things for breastfeeding) and he recommended the Avent because he said there was no problem with ever getting milk in the tubing, the bottles are designed much better for breastfeeding infants, the stimulators in the cups, and because of the iQ feature - it \"memorizes\" your preferred pumping pattern. He said the actual pumps, machine-wise, were comparable. I read a review in which a women who had tried both pumps said that parts were harder to get for the Avent. So I considered getting the medela for convenience. I tried the avent manual pump and I liked it, so I actually decided to go with the pump that I could get the best deal on since I couldn't really decide, and it turned out to be the Avent. I have loved it. It works very fast. Now I have not tried any other electric pump, but it is sure faster than the manual. I find it very easy to use and put together. I do not hurt from using it. I may be a little more tender than just breastfeeding, but it really isn't bad. I love the bag that it comes with -its very easy to store the pump and parts and cart around.

I have no idea what she is talking about because i have absolutely no problems with the tubing or taking it off. I do not pump every day.

My wife and I originally got this for our daughter, but find that we use it as much if not more.What it is:This is a plush turtle with a sleepy face that has a hard plastic shell.  The shell has holes in it that allows a light to shine through.  On the back of the shell are buttons that activate a light on the inside of the shell; the shell itself is translucent and glows different colors depending on the setting - green, blue, or orange.  The light also comes through the star-shaped holes (and one moon-shaped hole) to shine on the surrounding walls and ceiling.  The effect is something like being in a planetarium and is very mellow and soothing.  My daughter really likes it, but my wife and I positively love it.  One can either turn off the light manually, or leave them to turn off automatically after 45 minutes.  presumably after your little one is fast asleep)What it is for:This is a great little companion to soothe children to sleep if they are a little afraid of the dark or if they need a companion (the turtle) to be near as they go to sleep.  It works as a night light while it is on, but it won't serve that purpose after the light goes off.

One additional cool thing is that the stars are actually patterned as constellations, which project on the ceiling... yes, just like in a planetarium.

As of a few days ago, we've finally had to move our boy to a separate sleeping vessel, but prior to that they spent every night in the bassinet. We had to move our boy for 2 reasons: 1) he's getting a little hefty for this bassinet 2.) he's started night ninja moves that with the shared floor of the bassinet, wakes his sister. Our little girl happily still sleeps in it, though I'm not sure for how long as her length may start being a factor.I can not comment as to the playpen aspect of it yet as we haven't used it. The floor of the bassinet is the same as the floor to playpen and we haven't haven't had sagging problems others have mentioned, but that may be because the bassinets evenly spaces out the babies. For reference our little ones are 13lbs and 16+lbs. Even if we run into problems later, I would still say this was totally worth it instead of having a huge bulky crib in our bedroom. (That would have to be disassembled to get through the door!)The rating is 4 stars instead of 5 because the part that the babies lie on can be a bit wonky for a new parent. It has to fold up for travel, and as such each side has 2 vertical folds in it that is less than ideal. Babies may tend to slightly favor an area because of these little folds, and my guess is that can cause the dreaded flat head problem if it's constantly in the same position (rather them naturally moving their head where no folds would cause favoritism. Upon examination, I believe that the design could be corrected, but it wasn't a big deal for our particular situation. We did have a period where we placed towels under PART of the bassinet floor, but that was to help give it a slight incline that is sometime needed for twins.

We liked that they were spill proof and had handles to make it easier for her to hold the cup.

She can bang the darned thing upside down on her high chair tray and it won't leak a drop!  I have no idea why other reviewers have trouble cleaning these and have had the opposite experience. We have never had problems with mold or mildew, but to be fair she only drinks water from a cup (no juice at all, and she gets breastmilk from the tap or in a bottle) and we empty the cups after every use and wash them often. They're inexpensive so we were able to buy two 2-packs and have two at home and two for the daycare rotation.She will be transitioning to a straw-type cup for breast milk at daycare in another month or two, around her birthday.

I like the fact that this comes in a backpack, and at first glance doesn't look like a breatpump. I only have 1/2 hour to pump at work, and the double pump allows me to empty both breasts and still have a few minutes to clean up. The only drawback is the fact that Medela bottles are too small, (I pump 8 oz from each breast at a time), and my son does not like the nipples. To solve that problem, I purchased several sets of Playtex's One Step Breastmilk storage kits. The adaptor ring fits right onto the pump, and allows me to pump into a 4 or 8 oz liner. When I get home, the bottles go right into the freezer, and when my husband needs one, he puts it in warm water and then into the bottle. It makes pumping, storing and feeding our son so much easier. I would recommend this pump to anyone who will be going back to work but wants to continue giving their child breastmilk.": {"frequency": 1, "value": "I went back to ..."}, "I bought this for my son when he started crawling.

It turned out to be a great choice for us!For the first month, we used the hammock-type newborn attachment. I was too nervous to put my son in the tub without it while I was still getting the hang of things. He never looked quite comfortable in it though; his chin was bent into his chest. I adjusted the hammock several times without much improvement. He didn't seem to mind, though, and the hammock was a great help.Once I moved him to the infant (reclined) side of the tub, he looked more comfortable. His bottom slips out of place sometimes when he arches his back, but never to the point where he'd slide all the way down. (Of course, you should never leave your baby unattended in any type of tub.)I use this tub on my bathroom counter, but I can see how it would fit conveniently in the kitchen sink. However, bathtime at our house is after dinner, at which time our kitchen sink is usually full of dishes! I fill it from the bathroom sink using a large cup, and fill the sink itself with clean water to rinse. I put some baby wash in the small reservoir on the end of the tub and add warm water. I use this soapy water to wash the baby instead of putting the soap directly on the washcloth or on his skin. It wouldn't be very convenient to use this basin for rinse water because it doesn't hold much. I rinse with water from the sink using the same big cup I filled the tub with.The drain plug is very secure and we've had no problem with leaks. When bathtime is over and baby is safe in his crib, I move the edge of the tub over the sink and pull the plug to let it drain.

We haven't had any brown wipes, they are always moist.  Pampers wipes do work better than Huggies wipes because of the way they are packaged- the pampers wipes are folded into each other so when you pull one out it pulls another out.  The Huggies don't do this and then you have to open up the compartment each time which is aggravating.  Also, you really do have to keep on top of the \"pillow\"- it dries out and gets brown and hard pretty quickly, about every 4-5 days I've found so you have to remember to keep rewetting it.  The refill pillows are $7 a pack so I try to make them last as long as possible- it's worth it though because there haven't been any brown wipes unlike the other brands I tried.

As background, our first monitor was aPhilips AVENT Baby Monitor, which we like, but it lacks video.  Next we tried aGraco True Focus Digital Video Monitor, which has video and great nighttime brightness, but sound issues and daytime quality consistency problems.  This item is pretty pricy, especially considering it comes with only a parent unit, not a monitoring unit, and therefore requires you to use your own smartphone, tablet, or computer, and we had high hopes, but it feels like it may have been rushed to market.First, we encountered a minor annoyance during setup (which overall was easy, so that's one plus).  The manual, and a slightly corrected page that shipped with the unit (telling you to follow that slipsheet instead of the originally printed page) indicates the user should turn the unit off, hold the reset button, and then turn the power on while still holding the reset button, continuing to hold it until the unit beeps.  This resets the unit before use, and is to be repeated anytime you switch wi-fi networks.  This never happened for us - I held the button for about 30 seconds, then gave up, turned it off and tried it again, the second attempt holding it for well over a minute.  No beep.  So instead I turned the unit on first, THEN held the reset button, which was not the process that either the manual or the corrected page indicated, and that worked, eventually.  So, first strike, minor bug, no problem.Second, the setup on our iPad was buggy.  We had already set up the account on an iPhone without a problem, but the iPad app would not pop up a keyboard (no external keyboard, so that wasn't the issue, and we don't have this problem with any other apps), so it was impossible for us to sign in on the iPad app, unless we went out and purchased an external keyboard just for that.  I repeatedly restarted the app, and eventually it just worked on its own.  No changes in iPad settings.  Another minor software bug, probably something to be fixed in a later patch.  No big deal.Third, nighttime quality on this unit is pretty poor, even with brightness cranked up to the max.  We did a side-by-side comparison next to the Graco unit linked above, and there was just no contest - the quality on this unit is considerably grainier, and it's much harder to see details.  Motion is also a bit blurry, though some of that is to be expected when over wi-fi (although note that we have a solid router, and the unit is well within the range).  This is more of a problem.Fourth, when using the smartphone as the monitoring unit, which to us seems the most convenient given the size, we hear a bizarre purring/vibrating sound.  There is nothing on in the baby's room, and the other two monitors we've used do not have this problem.  The sound sort of pulsates or goes through a crescendo/decrescendo, fading in and out at regular intervals, but it's always there, even if you turn the volume way down.  This bothered us even more than the video quality issue.Fifth, because of the nonstop sound above, we tried not having the smartphone monitor constantly on, instead relying on push notifications.  The unit seems to be designed to send you a notification when sound is detected, which would lead you to launch the app and see what's going on with the baby.  This worked right after setup - we went into the room to adjust the camera, and my phone immediately popped up with \"sound detected.\"  Success.  But then it did not work consistently going forward.  It's not clear whether there's a huge delay between notifications, and we didn't see any way to adjust that delay if so, but about half an hour later, the baby went down a for a nap (no notification when we walked in and laid him down), and about an hour after that, the baby woke up, and we could hear him talking from another room, but still, no notification from the app.  I even turned a \"sound sensitivity\" setting up to max.  Nothing.  (But note when I tested the app from work, after logging in, it immediately sent me a \"sound detected!\" message, even though no one was in the room and it seemed completely silent to me.)Unfortunately, with the range of problems above, we find this unit to be unusable.  Even putting aside setup bugs (the first of which may just be an error in the manual, the second of which seems a simple software bug that could be patched), we have to choose between a constant purring/buzzing from leaving the app open and not being notified when there's a sound so you should launch the app (which completely defeats the purpose of having a monitor).We are disappointed, and will look forward to further versions of the product in the hopes Motorola works through these issues.": {"frequency": 1, "value": "We really wanted ..."}, "Love them. it's very flexible that you can place it anywear, curve or striaght.

She is taking it very well now - at 12 weeks she is using the #2 nipples and the 9 oz. bottles (she doesn't like the disposable bottles, so they just pour the milk into the bottle from the bag).  Now, I can pump about 4 oz. in the morning then nurse her and at work I take two breaks where I get at least 7 ozs in less than 10 min.  So, I am pumping what she eats each day (or more).  I try to push it a little to keep ahead.  The pump is so small, I just put it in a little tote bag and carry an insulated bottle bag for the milk (got that 'free' at the hospital).  I am so happy that she is still just getting breastmilk and we're still a few days ahead.  Its also wonderful that the system is interchangeable.  In the morning I pump into a regular bottle so her first bottle can be fresh.  That also works on the weekend.  I like to use the lids with the sealing disks to carry milk around in, the nipple lids leak sometimes.  I am interested in trying the soft sippy nipples with the bottle when she gets older.

Once I received it (I got 2, one for upstairs and one for downstairs), I read the very short and easy directions, and voila!  Perfect warmth on first use.  Whoever who states its too hot or too cold and complains about it clearly has not read the directions and did not try again because it tells you what to do if its not the temp you want.  To use this simple tool, you need to know if you have an old school bottle or the newer wide mouth bottle and how many ounces your bottle can hold (not how many ounces you're using) and whether you're starting from refrigerated or room temp.  These factors will tell you how much water to pour in the heater using a measuring vial that it comes with.  Press the button down (not in, I thought my warmers were broken) and you'll hear a click or see the light go off when it's done (in about a minute or so...amount of time for a diaper change).  If you leave it in there after its done it will keep heating and get too hot, just like when you're cooking on the stove and turn off the burner and your food keeps cooking.  Keep a rag/towel handy to wipe off the moisture around the bottle when its done.The reason why I give it only 4 stars is because the measuring vial is a pain in the a$$ to fill each time and you have to be exact with the amount of filling water to make your bottle the right temp, but the filling lines are so close together.  I'm planning on using a syringe so that I can have a fail safe, thoughtless, easy way to get the right amount of water in the heater.

I have not had a problem with my children pulling the velcro apart, but I'm very careful about aligning the velcro when wrapping the child.

Drop Ins worked well and really helped on colic but it was not very convenient as you need to push the air out before feeding and because my hand couldn't reach all the way, I had to use some kind of &#34;tool&#34; (like a milk collection bottle/ long tube etc) to push the air out. This is inconvenient especially when you are out and about - and if you forgot your &#34;tool&#34; then you will not be able to push all the air out. Also I had to keep the bottle in overturned position whenever my baby paused during feeding in order to prevent air from getting back into the liner (and then have to push the air out again) so this is very messy as milk will continue to come out from the teat in overturned position.So I switched to VentAire and I just love it! It doesn't give my baby any gas, reduce spit ups and it is so much easier to use. No more buying liners, pushing air out, keeping bottle overturned. There are more parts to wash but they are so easy to wash. I have used them for a month and only encountered 2 leaks because of human error. If you assemble them properly, they will not leak.

We have been using it for over a month now, and he loves it.  The hospital had recommended, on the advice of SIDS Australia, to keep the baby in your room with you for 6 months, and not in a crib in another room, as it is important for the baby to hear you breathing in order to 'remember' to breathe.  I had intended to have the crib next to us as we have an open plan apartment - I imagine many people could not fit one in their room - but this is a fine substitute (we do have a King bed though).  The side wedges are adjustable in width with velcro - I get them snug around his hips so he wouldn't be able to get in a bad position.  I just lift him out and put him on my Boppy pillow to nurse - very comfortable.  The light is great as when I put him down he spits up some milk every time and if I was putting him in a crib I don't know if I would even know this until he started crying.  My husband would not feel comfortable co-sleeping without this - he doesn't seem to wake at the slightest baby noise like I do.  Sometimes when I put Jack in the Snuggle Nest he is not asleep but I can rest my head next to it and look at him and close my eyes, and he closes his eyes in imitation and it helps him sleep.  Basically, co-sleeping is not contraindicated by SIDS researchers - they have a number of caveats though (if you smoke, are drunk, have many pillows/covers, a soft mattress, etc).  This Snuggle Nest keeps the covers and pillow safely away from the baby and keeps the baby from rolling toward you (important if you are heavy) or you from rolling onto him.  My husband is over 200 lbs and if the baby was lying next to him without this, the mattress would sag towards him and the baby would probably roll.  The Nest's mattress is firm which is recommended for babies (you can buy extra sheets for it as well).  Jack and I get more sleep not having to get out of bed.

This situation just presented itself to me in a strange internet-glitch type way.  When I do make a purchase, I do like to mildly compare before a purchase.  So when I was shopping for an outdoor blanket, after looking through various outdoor blankets, I was convinced that the Skip Hop blanket was the one for me.  However, according to Amazon, it would take several months for me to receive it because they were backordered.  I ended up making an order with Babies R Us.....which was later backordered.  It was close to soccer season and I needed one right away so I ordered the JJ Cole blanket because it could be delivered within a week.  I've been using the JJ Cole blanket for over a month now and I couldn't be happier with it.  It's very easy to roll out and when it's time to go, roll back up.  The quality is excellent.  Well, Monday afternoon, the Skip Hop outdoor blanket showed up on my doorstep and I took it to soccer practice to try it out.  Not too impressed.  The cooler bag that goes with it is teeny-tiny and you can't fit much in it.  The zipper makes it more difficult to lay out and fold back up and if you have a baby in your arms, it makes it that much more difficult.  The JJ Cole blanket is cheaper in price and better in quality and it's much easier to use.

So I can't completely disagree with this BUT of course when something is scented and is contained the smell is going to be stronger when you first open it and keep it in the same packaging. I have a quart sized Ziploc type bag in the diaper bag and that makes them portable and the smell isn't as strong but still you smell the scent not the poop (WHICH just a IMO, these work so great and even when the scent is really faded I would still rate these better then the others I have tried because they really keep the scent in and the scent of the bag I think is more for parents to think it makes it work better)Also for those of us that use them at home I put the in a used wipes box and feed them through this helps lessen the smell AND bring me two the 2nd problem some people have had trouble with2) The are hard to use (get out of box)So I have a solution for this... when I get a new box I open it completely and then separate it in thirds. Don't separate the bags  just put them in a empty pop up wipes box then carefully feed one through the pop up area and then gently pull up and use, the others will follow as long as you don't yank them out too hard or pull too fast.

I love the swift.At BRU we test drove a few strollers (after returning our borowed DuoGlider to the original owner... more of a sigh of relief than a sigh of anger!)Well we tried the DuoRider... This stroller was completely inferior to any double I had ever laid eyes on! The straps were flimsy lapbelts, there was minimal storage, only ONE canopy to cover both children (plus I cant imagine an average 3 year old fitting in it) it was too large, yet the seats were too cramped. The wheels were flimsy and squeaky, it was just horrible.I saw the double Jeep stroller, it was definatly an umbrella stroller. It was just TOO umbrella like, and it was too \"unsafe\" for the twins...So we laid eyes on the Swift. It was the double umbrella with a few bonuses that we were looking for.Its sturdy, that means the wheels wont spontaniously fall off like on the DuoGlider. I loved how easy it was to steer and manuver, and that it was very easy to turn as well. I absolutly LOVED that it could fold easily, but DEFINATLY not with one hand. It folds pretty small, and can fit well into the trunk of my minivan. I also love that the stroller is \"lightweight\", at 28 lbs... thats not too heavy, but not really too lightweight either. Theres 5 point harnesses for them, this was a big deciding factor on the swift, and they are well padded and secure. The seats reqline (another feature that we needed) and they reqline FULLY and sit up FULLY. The seats are easy to take off and wash, and equally easy to wipe up. They are comfortable, and definatly not the kind of material that makes children swet 5 liters! the handles are high enough for my husband, but also easy for me to hold as well. I love that they can hold bags on them also, this is ideal since the storage is minimal. We can fit a thin diaperbag in one (with diapers, wipes, powders, bottles, onesies, and two thin blankets) I also found that in the other basket I can fit children jackets, and a small purse for me. I purchased an add on stroller accesory kit which came with a drink holder for us, a snack cup for the kids, and a compartment for keys and a cellphone...

The white tray is attached at the point nearest to the baby's belly, and my dumpling grabs the far part of the tray and pulls it up and snaps it off the blue tray.  Cheerios go flying into her lap and other places.  But this is a relatively minor issue because washing the blue tray is just as easy.

It's so easy to clean.  I don't care how hard you try, or how well designed you think a potty seat is designed, it WILL get pee on it.  Fact of life.  The question is, does it wipe clean easily are you left in the bathroom scrubbing with an old toothbrush trying to get into all the cracks, nooks, and crannies?  The Baby Bjorn seat, with its simple, all-in-one design is easy to keep clean by wiping with a little toilet paper, and then disinfecting as often as you like with a disinfectant wipe.  On a side note, sometimes we wind up with pee on the regular toilet seat (from splashing underneath the Baby Bjorn seat) and sometimes we don't.  I'm not sure there's ANY potty seat out there that will guarantee you never ever have to wipe up pee.  We're talking about toddlers/preschoolers here...there will be some pee to wipe up from time to time.

My son sits comfortably now, and has room to grow (we started potty training around 20 months).  No, he can't get up and down by himself, but neither would I want him to at this age.  As he gets older and better able to use the potty by himself, he'll also be getting bigger and better able to get up and down by himself.

It was nice and convenient to have him right next to my bed and if he was sleeping I could just pick up the top part and move him with me. As a new mother I was getting up see if he is breathing every time I thought he was too quiet. So believe me, that nightlight was used ALL THE TIME. The running water and birds sounds were very soothing for me and the baby. I also loved the feature that you could turn the wheels and rock the bassinet. If you live in a little apartment every inch of space is valuable and the storage basket was very helpful too. The only thing I didn't use was the changing table.

We have had other plastic gates that worked fine but were broken off the wall by kids hanging and swinging on it. The KidCo metal gate opens from the center so we are hoping it will hold up much longer and not be an enticement to kids swinging on the open gate door. The only negative for me is the tripping hazard of the bar across the bottom of the gate or threshold. I have seen other gates that have a threshold more like one in a home. This bar on the threshold takes some getting used to and could be a hazard for someone who is not aware of it's height. The childproof locking feature is a plus!

This is for the first few months of a baby's life and should not move much, contrary to what the first poster said, because you want stimulation but you don't want to over-stimulate a baby. However, we did notice that sometiems our baby does like the mobile to move and it is summer here but the air conditioner blowing air around the room should be enough movement. When it's not moving, we can just put a small fan on its lowest setting about 6 feet from the crib and the small wiggling was enough movement to keep her stimulated but not so much movement that she can't keep track of the object (babies this young are not good at tracking so you don't want a lot of motion), but still we only do this once in a while, not at all times.One of the best things about this mobile is that our baby only wakes us up at night to feed. If she wakes herself up she will sit and stare at it for a long time and be happy since we have a small nightlight in the room. Any time we put her in the crib we can see her staring at the simple shapes. Shown in the picture on the product page is the detailed shapes, you flip the cardboard from the simple to the detailed shapes when they are about 2 months old, then remove this mobile for a more 'traditional' one with movement and objects the baby can grab at about 4 months. This is a somewhat delicate mobile since it uses air currents to move, so you need to keep it safe from a grabbing/eating baby.Also, one nice feature is that ours came with a travel pack, or at least that's how I'm using it. Besides the crib mount, there is an 8 inch circular plastic ring with fishing wire for hanging the mobile. You can hang it anywhere with a string, either taping string to the ceiling or tying it to any overhang. It also came with a cardboard carrying case thing which is very thin and easy to take with you on a trip.For those with a math/science background, it's really interesting to note that first side of the cards have objects with very low spatial frequency. The 'detailed' sides are actually the same patterns, but with a moderately higher spatial frequency. After 4 months, you use standard mobiles, which have very high spatial frequencies, as well as colors and things the baby can grab to improve hand-eye coordination. Basically, you start showing the child very low frequency objects that are easy to observe and track, then gradually move up until they can use the high frequency information.Now, I want to explain why I did not give this item 5 stars even though it's an amazing product. Before my baby was a month old, I noticed that she was already able to detect some colors and this stim-mobile is only black and white. This is from 1990, so I guess over the last 20 years they have refined the product so that the simple side has some red (first color a baby sees) and other simple colors, while the reverse side has more vivid colors, but uses the same idea of going from low spatial frequencies to higher spatial frequencies. I ordered the newest version but still kept this around for changing table and pack n play entertainment since she loves it.

Why use soft cloth to then slap paper on top? In reality, while they're not super soft, they're so thin, I feel like they compact and mold well to the baby and don't seem to irritate at all. Additionally, I find I can wash the liners that had been urine soaked a few times with the soiled diapers before needing to toss it and after being washed they get very soft, like a very thin and gauzy cotton which feels almost pleasant to the touch.I will absolutely keep using these and recommend them to everyone I know who is currently diapering.": {"frequency": 1, "value": "I've been spraying ..."}, "Great Product ...

It looks good, it folds compactly, and I'm really happy with the value.  I will say that folded up, it's a tad heavy but that's what you expect from a durable double stroller.

Fisher Price Healthy Care Booster seat had the best reviews and we decided that we would purchase that seat.When I looked at the booster seat more carefully in the store it was a great seat.  It had everything we needed.  The price was a little on the high side but with all the great reviews, we decided to buy it.  As we were walking to the register we realized that we only wanted a booster seat.  The Fisher Price booster had a detachable tray.  What made this seat so great was that it was like the Fisher Price high chair with the dishwasher safe inserts on the tray.  We did not need the trays.  The boys high chairs had adjustable height and we had been using them with out the trays and sliding them up to the table to eat.  All we wanted was a booster for the chairs.We went back to look over all are other options.  Most of the boosters came with trays and others clipped onto the side of your table.  The Safety First 3 Level Booster was the simplest one for the best price.It straps onto your chairs.  There is only one strap but it is very long.  It straps around the back of your chair.  The underside of the chair has rubber feat to prevent it from sliding.  It does say if you have cushions to remove them off the chair.Weight limit I believe is 40-50 lbs.  Your child will be 4-5 by then and should be able to sit in a regular seat.It is in two pieces: the seat and the base.  You select the height level you want and slide the seat into the slot.Very simple for clean up.  No little cracks or crevices.  Can even take it to the sink and wash it down.Does not come with seat belt.  There are slots for seat belts.  I believe you can call the company and order one if you need too.  We have not had any issues.  Since you are using your own chairs they slide under the table.It does not fold up like other boosters for easy travel.  It is not bulky or heavy though.Most booster seats come with a tray.  If your are looking for just a booster this one is a very fair price.  Other booster seats clip onto the side of your table.

I'm looking for the original firmware and am planning to wipe the Motorola version clean and get it back to a stock Wanscam. It may actually turn out useful if I can get rid of the crappy software on it now, and get it running as it was originally intended. Interesting how it only costs 55 bucks as opposed to two-fifty for this iteration. 50 bucks is about right for this cam.And now back to the original review.....I really wanted to like this cam. But the price is just far too high to justify the seriously hampered functionality. If you're a tech challenged customer, then you might be drawn to the innocuous setup, compared to a Foscam FI8910W, which requires minimal IP knowledge. I get it - parents are busy enough, and don't necessarily want to learn basic IP config. However, my setup of this Motorola wasn't exactly problem free, and if you can handle following a couple paragraphs of instructions, then Foscam will deliver far more than this Motorola ever could.> Incompatible With Latest Java on PCMotorola has all kinds of warnings on their website saying this cam is NOT compatible with the latest version of Java. Motorola's solution? Downgrade to an older version of Java, just so this crappy little cam can work. Personally, I don't think it's worth the trade-off. Java usually only updates their platform when there's a security vulnerability. So downgrading to a less secure version of Java just so I can use this cam, is NOT an acceptable solution. Get your act together Motorola. It's your job to get this stuff working with the software that you selected to use it with. You didn't have to pick a Java interface, but you did, so make it play nice with Java, or scrap it, and come up with an alternative.*Note* - If I open a web browser and type in this cam's IP address, I can access it directly and control the Pan & Tilt. It just doesn't seem to work with Motorola's online software for some reason.> Wonky Setup on AndroidI downloaded Motorola's Android app, and setup was hardly quick and easy. The setup kept failing and I had to run it about 6 times before it finally worked. The process was very slow, buggy, and took 45 minutes of tinkering. Hardly user friendly for someone looking for a quick and easy setup. And I know what I'm doing (I can get a Foscam working within 5min out of the box.) The process is sorely lacking in a manual setup option, and the automated one barely works. Advanced users are shackled to a buggy automated setup, and the tech challenged would certainly be lost in the quagmire, so who is benefiting from the \"convenience\" here?> Limited FunctionalityI don't really get the concept of a \"baby\" cam. Since when do parents ONLY want to keep an eye on their children when they're toddlers? What parents really need is an affordable security system. With multiple cameras and the ability to record and playback footage, just like a DVR. Yes, you want to watch your baby. But when they're old enough to crawl into another room, don't you want to keep an eye on that too? Maybe check in on them, and the babysitter, when you go enjoy dinner on a rare night out? Or make sure your teenage kids aren't at home cutting school while you're at work. Or if one of life's little accidents happen, wouldn't it be nice to check the security footage and see exactly what happened? All this IS possible with Foscam, and NOT even remotely possible with this Motorola in its current form.> Small AntennaYou're not getting very far from your router with this thing. And the antenna can't be upgraded, so that's that.> No Network PortJust because something can be wireless, doesn't mean it always should be. I have a lot of WiFi cams on our security setup, however, I always run a network cable to the cams whenever possible. Fact is, wired is just more reliable than wireless. So when possible, run a wire, and save the wireless for situations where it's the only option. It'll reduce the radio frequencies swarming around your environment, and the devices that are hooked up wirelessly, will work better as a result.> Poor Image QualityThe resolution just isn't there, no matter if I use standard or HQ settings. This Motorola looks more like a cheap webcam than an expensive WiFi baby monitor.> Pan & Tilt Is ResponsiveGood news here - the pan and tilt functions are snappy and responsive. And the digital zoom is ok.> LullabiesNice feature that works well. But the volume is quite low. Don't recall seeing an adjustment for it.> Local and Remote ViewingLocal viewing means you're NOT accessing the cam through the internet. Which is a good thing, because that means you can watch the cam all day long at home, and not rack up any extra data charges. When you're away from home, you can remotely check in on the cam for up to 5 minutes at a time. Then you have to reload the video stream. They do this so people are cognizant of how much data they may be using on their cell phones or work computers. It's a good thing.> Night Vision - it's ok. > Audio - it's ok too. > Compact - Foscam is larger, but does more.> Limited Mounting Options - either place this Motorola on a desk or shelf, or hang it from the one screw hole on the back. Problem is, cameras like this need to be hung upside-down, not sideways on a wall. Why? Because all your images will be skewed and off kilter if you hang this on a wall. I call it \"Batman Supervillan Angles\" cuz on the old TV show, the bad guys were always shown with tilted angles, cuz they're 'crooked' crooks. Not a good thing for a baby cam.Bottom Line - this cam costs far too much and does far too little. And what little it can do, it doesn't do very well. Just not worth the cost or trouble to setup. Not to beat the drum here, but again go with Foscam if you at all want anything decent. No I don't work for them, they just make really good stuff and i know that cuz I've tried a lot of security cams.

It is extremely sensitive with no static at all.2.  The range is good- I can use it outside in the garden without a sacrifice in quality.  The belt clip is helpful for such times.3.  The light readout is far more helpful than I had anticipated.  It indicates the intensity of the sound on the other end with the number of lights.  This is useful because if you routinely adjust the volume on the receiver as I do, it's hard to objectively assess what's going on in the other room based purely on the sound level.  Also the visual feedback is useful for when you're doing something noisy that doesn't lend itself to wearing the receiver in vibrate mode-in my case that means showering or running on the treadmill.Con:1.  The monitor does eat batteries (as most of them do).  We generally leave it plugged in during overnights and just use the batteries when we carry the monitor during daytime naps.2.  After 6 months, the vibrate mode doesn't work as well as it once did.  I don't use it much anyway, so this isn't much of a problem for me.I would definitely recommend this product.

It's light, easy to fold/open.  Wasn't bulky, had a basket on the bottom, and what I really loved was the adjustable angle for the push handles.  I'm 5'7\" and it seems like alot of strollers are made for people shorter than me so this was a great incentive to get it.  The price was very resonable too.Long story short - I bought it and used it until my son grew out of it.  I loved it - didn't have any complaints and if I had to do it all over again I'd buy the same one.

I went on consumer reports, I went into many baby sites and I finally chose the Hippo hook-on. It just seemed so practical and since neither my wife or I have any aversion to returning a poorly performing product I felt we had nothing to lose.So we get to the store and my wife quickly decides a standing chair with cute sounds and colorful images was a better choice at $80.00 and my review and research time went hurriedly out the window.Because she never even looked at the Chicco product and went straight to the traditional chairs I quickly became annoyed and frustrated and expressed those feelings freely at every opportunity I had.We got home, I assembled the chair as any well-trained husband would and you might think the story was over there. Then again I would be writing about THAT chair instead of this one wouldn't I? In fact I wouldn't be writing at all...I digress.Being the intuitive and loving wife that she is, she went out a few days later and got the Hippo hook-on...TOO. She actually bought both and SHE agreed they could both find use in our happy home. I figured I had won a moral victory in the least, pushing out of my mind that we now had $130.00 worth of feeding chairs that no less than half of which was unneccessary. I shredded the divorce papers and we went on feeding our baby.I lowered and secured our little girl into her standing chair and she fussed every time, equating it I guess to every other restraint equipped device we hook her into. But the hook-on chair was different...she was at the same table, at the same level as the rest of us and she was smiling and playing. And that was one of those unexpected intangibles that don't get onto the labeling or specification lists of baby products.And you may think the story was over there but it wasn't...we took our hook-on chair to restaurants, to friend's and families' homes and I would be lying if I told you it fit on ALL tables because it didn't. But it has only NOT fit (in 3 months time) on two tables that we've attempted, and that's pretty good odds.As the story ends, my fair and lovely wife watched the hi-chair she bought get tripped over, pushed aside unused, and ultimately collect dust as so many primary colored baby items do over time.In the end, she saw $80.00 sitting there and quietly returned her chair.Now I have nothing against traditional standing chairs and perhaps if this chair hadn't been invented we would be just silly listening to the cutesy sea-themed jingles over and over again.

I have one thing to say about this...money should not be an issue when you are purchasing a safe ride for your child.  The seat is expensive but in my opinion it is well worth the money spent.  I purchased this seat for my son two years ago and I am now using the same seat for my daughter.  I was tempted to get a new seat for my daughter (something more feminine) so I checked out the Graco Snugride....it didn't fit into my back seat very well and therefore moved around a lot.  The Peg Perego seat is much easier to secure into my vehicle than the Graco seat.  Both of my children are so snug when they are properly fastened into the seat that I don't worry about their safety.  I hope I never have to find out first hand of course but I have great confidence in this seat.  Aside from the safety, I also have noticed that both children seem to be very comfortable in the seat.  They sleep well in the seat even on long trips.Once your child outgrows the Peg Perego seat I highly recommend the Britax Roundabout or Marathon car seat (depending on the size of your vehicle would determine which one to purchase).  The roundabout works for children 5 to 40 lbs. and the Marathon is designed for 5 to about 65 lbs.  They are both great seats but the Marathon is rather large.  Either seat is a great investment in your child's safety.Last tidbit...never be afraid to go to the store and ask to try different car seats in your vehicle.  Even if Consumer Reports determines that a car seat is the best on the market, remember that every back seat is different and that same seat may not fit in your car.  At Babies R Us, an associate will accompany you to your car with different seats and allow you to try them before you purchase.  Not every seat is designed to be the safest in your car so you have to check and see how each seat fits into your car.

Some points of interest:- This cup may keep drinks colder \"twice as long as regular cups\" as it claims but PLEASE DO NOT TRUST THAT IT WILL KEEP PERISHIBLE ITEMS COLD (OR HOT) FOR AN EXTENDED PERIOD OF TIME such as a Thermos type of insulated vessel.  I have a Thermos type of vessel with a flip cap that I use for keeping ice water cold throughout the day - I can leave ice water in it all day or all night and there is still ice in it 12 hours later.  In the hopes that I could send milk with my preschooler in these cups (which we have been using for three years), I did an experiment.  At 5 pm I put 4 ice cubes and cold water from the refrigerator filter in the cup.  I stirred it around with an accurate digital thermometer until the ice was almost melted and the temperature read 39.2 degrees f.  At 10:14 pm I opened the cup and again took the temperature of the water - and it was 70.7 degrees f, in a room that was air conditioned to 70 degrees.  That's right - ROOM TEMP IN 5 HOURS!!  Just so you know, it may be insulated but it is not serious insulation.  Like I said, we have used these cups for 3 years, and I always thought they kept drinks cooler than non-insulated cups but never really paid attention to how long they stayed cold.  Knowing that I wouldn't be there to check my child's milk and if it was kept cold, I just had to know for sure HOW well it worked and if my child could sip from it all day long.  Because of the results of this experiment, I send water in his cup instead of milk.- Do not overtighten.  When I tighten the lid so that the arrow is on the tighter end of the \"closing range\" delineated area, it is difficult to open.  I use a clean square of that non-skid flexible rubber grid that you can put under rugs so they don't slip when you walk on them.  It works better than any other commercial made rubber type of jar opener, at least out of the ones I have tried.  I usually tighten the lid just so the arrow is almost to/just at the looser end of the \"closing range\" delineated area.- Make the holes in the rubber stoppers bigger.  I take a razor sharp knife and make the \"minus\" sign shaped slits into \"plus\" signs.  This allows for more flow and easier drinking.  This also can allow slight leaking, just so you know, but usually only a few drops (if at all).  Just do it a little and then test it - actually drink from the cup to see how easy or difficult it is to get liquid out and adjust accordingly.  I personally test drive ALL my kids' cups first - you would be surprised how difficult it is to get any liquid from many kids cups!- I have read other reviewers say they take the rubber stopper out when their child is at the table, etc. so they can drink more quickly.  I have found this also to be true and it works great in that capacity.- Beat the heck out of them.  These things are virtually indestructible!- There is no plastic smell that I have noticed from the six or so that we have purchased in the past 3 years.  I like that.

It's an excellent idea and very functional.  I have no problem converting it from a seat to a stroller and back again with our daughter in it, although my wife struggles with it a little bit.For vacations, the sit and stroll is a godsend, I like the fact that it will fit with both car seat belts and has an attatched latch system (the latter of which I think is much more secure)There are some drawbacks, these being:1) The handle seems rather flimsy,2) The stroller doesn't like being pushed off deep curbs.  The front wheels seem to jam underneath it and it requires you to lift the unit forward with your foot before you can proceed,3) Our child is of a size where she is between rear-facing and forward facing.  We cannot put her forward facing right now because she is too small and the belt is at her throat (when it should be across her chest), but rear facing, her legs are scrunched up against the rear of the car seat.  There is no way I can install it with her in it at this size which makes putting her in the seat difficult.  This will cease to be a problem when she is bigger and forward facing, but it is a problem now.4) I have no idea how you install this rear facing in an aircraft, there just isn't enough room between seats (certainly in economy class).  Most airlines insist the seat is forward facing anyway and we have settled for latching the aircraft seat belt through the mechanism on the back of the unit.5) I wish the guides that the car/airplane belts ran through were raised a little higher on the seat, when a belt is in place it runs very tight across my daughters legs or chest, restricting her movement significantly.These aren't major gripes though.

Haven't used any other so no idea what the industry standard is. My only complaints are really minor, not deal breakers but enough to wish on a rating star for.Good news:It appears durable enough, we've been using it about a year now but only for travel, which we don't do all that often.The way it straps on to the back and bottom of a chair feels really secure.Easy to cleanI like that it includes a tray cover to keep the part they eat from clean when travelingWhat could be better:The \"boost\" doesn't go so high, could probably use a bit more height for short kids.The tray is kind of low when babies start to grow a bit, there's not a lot of space between the baby's thighs and the tray. My kid is even on the petite side. I realize part of the point of the booster is to raise the kid to reach the adult table, but sometimes you just don't want 'em there. But overall I imagine a heftier kid than mine would probably start to feel squished in this seat sooner than you'd want.The inner (white) tray snaps off MUCH too easily. I was looking forward to having it both as a spare and to be able to easily bring it to the sink to rinse off, but instead I rarely use it and it's just an extra piece in the way because from the very beginning my 1-year-old could easily pry it off and send food flying. No good.And this is not a problem with the product, in fact it's exactly as described, but I just think people should know this is NOT a full high chair replacement. That would be the excellent \"Space Saver\" booster which I'm about to review. But even though I didn't start my little one on table food until she was able to sit independently anyway, the seat of this booster was still not supportive enough for her at that point (I think she was about 9 months old when we first got this) - she was too little and wiggly and it just wasn't the same as high chair seats usually are more contoured. The tray is small too, which is perfect for travel and toddlers but not ideal for beginning eaters who don't yet understand how to keep their food in one place.Overall, this is an item that I'm very happy to have in my car trunk, but for home I'd probably get a more basic booster when my kid outgrows the high chair. The trays would be squashing her legs by that point and the boost isn't so high, I think most plainer seats would do the job very well or better for home.

When I had my daughter I received a big old hand-me-down Graco stroller from a relative, but hated trying to get it all situated when I just needed to run in the store for something.  It was the old kind that the carrier didn't snap into, but I didn't want to get one of those big bulky systems, either.  Then a friend told me about the Snap 'N Go, and I can't tell you how happy I am!!!It was so easy to assemble, easy to figure out how to adjust the bars, and SUPER lightweight... very comparable to an umbrella stoller in weight.  I would just lift the carrier out of the car and right into this, it's so easy!  It also rides VERY well, and the basket in the bottom is so large, I can even go to the grocery store for small trips.The best thing is that it saves you so much money over buying one of the (bulky) travel systems.  Once my daughter outgrew (at about 6 months old), I just bought a cheap-o stroller without all the bells and whistles, which did the job for another six months until she was big enough for an umbrella stroller.This is now the gift I give at every baby shower I attend... whether the mother has registered for it or not!

My sis-in law had the diaper champ & I couldn't believe she even had any dirty diapers around...there was no smell!  We chucked the genie and bought the champ. It was so much easier to use...just roll the diaper into a little ball and drop into the hole on top, flip the handle and bye bye smelly diaper (my 16 month old can do it) And there were no special bags to buy, just the same regular garbage bags we used already in the kitchen. Experienced parents will understand and appreciate that it comes apart for easier cleaning for those times when it may become a mess.  We had a problem with odors after about a year of use so I called BabyTrend to see what they recommended.

Also, my sister has been using these for her baby since he was born, and he's about two years old now and she's still just as in love with them as ever. Probably its greatest perk for me is that it's safe. Because my baby is wearing the blanket, he's not gonna kick it or pull it over his face, and my baby is a mover! He's always ending up in the corners of his crib facing different directions, so blankets would get thrown everywhere with him, so it's a big deal to me to not have to worry about him smothering. Also, I have the security of knowing he will stay warm all through the night. He's not gonna lose his covers, so I don't feel the need to go check on him in the middle of the night to make sure he's covered up. Also, it seems to wash out really well. Babies are very messy, but the spit up and baby food seems to wash out just fine in the washing machine! Overall, I think it's a fantastic product. I can't think of a thing I don't like about it. While it is a bit pricey to have to buy a new blanket for your baby as they grow, it's worth it to me considering the warmth and safety the sleepsack provides.

I got it specifically for the purpose of making a quick trip to the grocery store, doctors office, or a quick lunch out with the girls.  I don't want to carry my gargantuan full size bag everywhere.  It suits this purpose very well - and then some.I can fit a capped bottle pre-filled with water in the bottle carrier, plus extra drop-ins and nipples. (I use the Playtex drop-in bottles so if I need more than one bottle out, I just pack extra nips and liners)  In the top portion, I can fit a full pack of travel wipes (Huggies or pampers on the go sets), 3 small diapers (sz 1) and 2-3 larger diapers (sz 4)  I can also usually slide my wallet in this section.In the middle compartment, I have a onsie and pants and a receiving blanket, and several small toys for my toddler (some plastic dinosaurs, tiny cars, and 2 small playdoh packs and a plastic knife for cutting them up)In the bottom section, I have a container for powdered formula and a scoop, a disposable diaper bag container, and usually a bagged snack for the toddler (goldfish or cheerios)On the front I carry my keys in the top pocket, and sanitizer and spare socks in the longer compartment.  In the bottom, I carry a pack of gum and a pen.This bag works great for us, its easy to get on and off, easy to clean, and holds quite a bit.  We've had it in use for a month, and I love it!

She wants to be held *all* the time, and it was getting pretty exhausting in our arms (and my chronic tendonitis was flaring up) until we ordered the sling after reading about it in Dr. Sears's The Baby Book.  I had my doubts, but boy has it been a lifesaver!The sling has been invaluable for me, my husband, and our regular sitter. With it, we are able to walk, bounce, give the calming pinky finger treatment, and see what's going on with the baby. She started using the sling at 2 weeks, when she was about 7 pounds. It took a few times, but she is now completely comfortable in it and it is a favorite napping spot.As I am large-breasted, I did find it awkward to breastfeed in it, although I've been able to do it successfully a couple of times in public sitting down.  The fabric is soft and easily washable (important for those baby mishaps).  The padding helps me feel comfortable as a bit of protection in case of bumping.  The size is very adjustable for different height people, although you may need to pull through a lot of fabric to bring small babies in tightly, especially if you have a smaller chest size.The NoJo sling would benefit from having some loose fabric at the end to cover the baby's head in the sun and provide more coverage during breastfeeding. The stopper piece of plastic at the end of the fabric adds safety (it won't pull through), however it can whack the baby if you aren't careful when getting it on or off.  It could also use a zippered storage area, a feature of some other slings.  Also, the blue with plaid seems to be the only fabric sold these days, although I have seen other patterns and colors on eBay.  This is fine with jeans, but not great when you have to go to a wedding, as I did with the sling earlier this summer. I think it also makes people think that she's a boy, for some reason.  Maybe it's the blue and the fact that they can't see her cute dresses!The sling is also helpful in keeping interested strangers at a slight distance away from the baby -- they are less able to grab at her, which I think is good from a germ perspective, especially for newborns. When it is very hot or humid out, this sling can be a bit heavy for the baby (especially up against a hot mama!), but on cooler days the fabric adds just the right amount of warmth, like a light blanket.When I was pregnant, I assumed the Baby Bjorn would be all we would need. Instead it hangs on a hook most of the time unless we're going for a long walk or shopping -- activities where having two hands is important and you'll be doing them for a while. That thing is so hard to get on and off! Plus, you aren't supposed to use it until they are 8 lbs. The baby seems to really like the flexibility of positioning with the sling -- especially curling up happily in a womb-like ball -- and sometimes gets irritated by being all dangled out in the Bjorn.Carrying the baby in the sling makes you so much more mobile than using a stroller or lugging her around in her heavy carseat, so I use it whenever I anticipate being in public where they are stairs, space issues, or other impediments.  It's good for short shopping trips as well, especially if you're with a friend who can carry things or push a cart, both of which are harder to do with the sling on.She's also a million times more comfortable in the sling than in her car seat, where she often cries.  Our NoJo Babysling has been in constant use since it arrived, and ties the bouncy seat (where she mostly sleeps by day) as the best return on investment of any of the baby gizmos we bought.  Our sitter will often wear the baby for her entire nap. The sitter just sits (often in a rocking chair or porch swing to provide some more movement) and reads while the baby sleeps.One last thing that's great is that when the baby falls asleep, she can be laid down on the bed or bouncy chair and the sling just slips off the wearer without waking the baby.I did not watch the video, but did read the sling chapter in the Baby Book, which was helpful. We have recently started using the kangaroo (facing out) position as the baby loves looking at the outside world now. It's nice to have this sort of flexibility.  If you are getting tired carrying around your baby, and would like an extra hand free, a sling is a great investment and while not the most elegant, the NoJo is a good workhorse one to use on a daily basis.": {"frequency": 1, "value": "I am the the ..."}, "Well made and quite a few different textures.Toddler loved this book and Mom approved, too.Everyone was happy with this selection.": {"frequency": 1, "value": "Well made and ..."}, "I absolutely love the Kiddopotamus SwaddleMe line.

The pumps you get in medical stores look like bicycle horns, and the good ones==there's very little choice (I've seen a philips Avent, a Pigeon, and a Farlin, which are among the good ones, but I've only seen single models of each of these brands without much choice in stores). I just wanted to be sure, so after reading rave reviews for this particular one, I decided to go for it.I did not plan to pump too much because I work from my home office, but I have an oversupply and manually expressing milk to relieve the pressure was way too time consuming. I didn't want to end up with blocked ducts mastitis and all the other problems that come with oversupply. Before this pump arrived I was already battling a clogged pore.If you have a good supply of milk (evidenced by the fact that y our baby is satisfied after feeds, not by the amount you can hand express), then you will be able to pump enough with this manual pump. I used to manually express into a graduated bottle to see how much I could produce, and I would get 2 oz a side after say 20 minutes each and a lot of pressing and pain. With the Medela Harmony I am able to produce 4 oz from one side within about 10 minutes, no pain, no need to struggle. I don't even push the pump all the way.Pros:-This manual pump is good if you are an SAHM, pump to relieve oversupply, or pump infrequently for other reasons.-It comes with an extra bottle, lid, nipple, stand, and cap.-The two pumping strengths simulate the initial suckling to sitmulate letdown and the slower, longer suckling motions of babies.-The suction is pretty strong but it can be minimized if the handle is pushed down only part way.-It comes with an instruction manual.Cons:-The apparatus looks daunting at first with little parts here and there, but it's easy to get the hang of after a single dismantle/reassembly.-The pumping mechanism is directly connected to the bottle and flange, etc., so they come in direct contact with each other. This means everytime you need to use it, it needs to be sterilized/sanitized.-There is a tiny white &#34;washer&#34;-like ring that attaches the pump to the rest of the assembly. This came off while I was sterilizing my Harmony the second time after I bought it. Luckily I noticed it, figured out where it goes and popped it back on.

Originally, though, I wanted a sling because I thought they were better for baby, like the previous reviewer, and all my crunchy friends recommended them.  They may be, but we've tried the hotsling, the maya wrap, and even the ergo baby carrier, and this is by far the best and easiest for us.For months, the only way to get my baby to stop his colicky crying was to put him in the Bjorn and go for a walk.  It would put him right to sleep like magic, and we'd come inside, lean over his rocker, and unlatch the Bjorn with him in it (the outer piece comes completely off) and he would just stay asleep.  Try that with a sling!Now that he's past his colicky phase, I use the sling a lot and it's great, but for a quick run to the store, nothing beats the Bjorn for speed.  It's so easy to put on and take off - and it's also easier to get my husband (and my dad!) to wear the baby with the Bjorn, he thinks the sling is for moms.I had two problems: at about 20 pounds and 27 inches, his arms don't fit in the arm holes, and they don't fit above them either.  It still works without the top latches, though, and it's cooler in summer.  I just keep a hold on him to be sure.  And when he was a couple months old and I was wearing the Bjorn a lot, I got a plugged milk duct.  I thought it was about where the strap lay on my chest, so I stopped wearing the Bjorn for a while.

I bought the Baby Trend because there were no local stores that carried the Joovy for me to look at it. So, I bought the Baby Trend, took it home, strolled around my house and found it was to big, I was hitting wall corners and could not see what was infront of me. I would have to lift the stroller to go around tight corners. So, I went on the hunt to fond this Joovy stroller to test out. I finally found a retailer, drove 40 miles to test it out and it was worth it. I could manouver it well, I had my son sitting and my infant car seat attached and strolled around the store perfectly. It was easy to fold and pick up also. Attachments went on and came off easily. I was so pleased, wondering what the bad reviews were about, those people are crazy!! Here are some things I found were not hard or inconvienat at all that others did:1. The storage basket accessability: Yes, when your child is standing or sitting in the back area it is impossible to get to the basket from there, BUT WHY WOULD YOU ANYWAY???? The sides pull out so far that there is no need to access the basket any other way.2.The wheels do not turn well: OK, this has to be due to no readng the owners manual! There is a lock on the front wheels that keeps them from swiveling if in lock posistion. Once unlocked the wheels swivel to make sharp turns at ease. The only way I knew this is because I read the manual!3. The rear seat has little room when front seat in reclined: This is a fact, BUT the back seat slides back and forth, so if the seat is reclined you just pull the back seat foward more! AGAIN, READ THE MANUAL!4.No parent tray: OK, this was the only one that I can say is valid. BUT, there are so many universal trays out there and accessories to hold drinks, phones, MP3 players, ect that this should not be a big deal. Joovy sales one for the stroller, which is a little pricey, but I bought a off brand for a quarter of the price and it works great.So, overall I LOVE this stroller and I am so happy I went with it and not the Baby Trend.

They're easily washed and cared for and contiune looking new for a long time! The padding on this stroller is amazing - there aren't enough words to describe it! The boot is great for keeping little ones warm and cozy - especially on those cold and rainy days (we don't get much snow here in Seattle!) When the seat is upright the hood can be brought down to the boot to make a safe enclosure from the weather! The reversalble handle is nice, as is the height adjustment on it! The new black nubby wheels handle beautifully - I know many mention having problems on uneven sidewalks, I never experienced this with the new wheels. It's easy to push, even with one hand. The new snack bar is also nice - with a cup holder and large tray area!What I didn't like so much:Despite the adjustable height handle - it's still a little too short for me (at 5'11&quot;) I did kick the back a few times. The fold is easy enough, but the hooks to keep it locked in place came off a few times, they just slide over the peg.

I wasn't originally going to buy an exersaucer at all, due to studies suggesting that these mechanisms slow down the time it takes a baby to learn to walk. Then I decided I didn't care what studies had shown---my baby needed some entertaining, had mostly gotten bored with lying on his back on his activity mat, and I simply couldn't spend every second of every day entertaining him!I am primarily writing this review to dispel concerns others have had about this model, and to praise Evenflo for their excellent customer service.First, I want to address the time it takes to put this toy together. It took me half an hour from start to finish, which seems to be how long it has been taking most people. To some, this might seem like a long time, but I really wasn't bothered by it. Plus, the instructions are VERY straight-forward, so I don't really see how, if following the instructions, anyone would have actual trouble putting it together.Second, the first thing I did after putting the ultrasaucer together was call Evenflo's customer service to find out if there were other toys I could get to replace the joker and mirror (after reading so many negative comments about these toys, I didn't want to take any chances, even though the joker was the \"newer\" version with the rounded top). The representative I spoke with was very helpful and offered to send me toys from a different model to replace them. Plus, the castle piece that came with my ultrasaucer popped out much too easily, so I asked to have that replaced, too. No problem--the only thing I had to agree to do was send the parts I didn't want back to them in a prepaid envelope, which was fine with me. Though I was told it might take up to two weeks to receive the replacement toys, it actually took less than 5 days. In sum, great customer service, with no questions asked!Moving on to how my son feels about his exersaucer.....he LOVES it! He is almost seven months old now (we bought the ultrasaucer when he was six months old, which I personally think is an appropriate age to start using this), and greatly enjoys spending time in his ultrasaucer. Though I try to avoid leaving him in it for too long, he would probably be content to stay there for close to an hour if I let him. Surprisingly, the only toy he doesn't care for is the soft frog, which isn't a big deal, since I can take the frog off of the \"rod\" it is attached to and put a different toy on the rod. He loves all of the other toys, and I think his favorite is actually the knight that rocks back and forth (my least favorite...go figure). His second favorite toy is the soft flag, which he LOVES to suck on. The most fun he has though, comes from being able to jump up and down, which he does...a lot!I have not had any problems with this toy since purchasing it, and my son has never been hurt using it. Also, I find the collapsible feature very convenient for taking the ultrasaucer on trips. I don't think it's hard at all to collapse, unlike some other reviewers. It takes about 30 seconds to do.All in all, I think this was $80 well spent, particularly since I can use this for future children.": {"frequency": 1, "value": "I did extensive ..."}, "Got these to help with cold air in the winter.

The one about the baby boy's private parts getting pinched and STUCK, requiring medical attention, scared me in to finding a bath that didn't have any seams or grooves or moving pinchable parts.This bath is large and doesn't fold at all, but I loved it nonetheless. I gave up the bottom portion of a hallway closet for storage, removing a shelf, and it was totally worth it. It's useful for infants who can't sit up unsupported if you use the reclining direction. Then when they're older, you put them in facing the other way and they can safely and comfortably sit up without slipping or tipping. I think its size contributes to its sturdiness and safety.Our first HATED baths of any kind for almost the first year, but even so, this bath kept her safe and supported so it made the not-so-fun task of giving a bath a little more tolerable.We loaned it out to a friend in between kids and now have it back only we're missing one of the tubes for the drain. I was going to just go to the hardware store and rig something up, but instead called the company today (PrimoBaby) and they're sending me one out, free of charge. Can you even believe it?

I know it's a cheap part that probably costs them 5 cents, but it'll cost me more than that in gas for me to drive the 1/2 mile to the store to find something similar that may or may not work.In conclusion: Yes, it's large, but other than that, I have zero complaints which is more than I can say for just about any other product I currently own.": {"frequency": 1, "value": "At first I was ..."}, "I purchased this toy as a Christmas gift for my six month old daughter, but I let her play with it for a while before wrapping it.

My 4-month old has only been taking 20 minute cat-naps and I needed some way to encourage longer sleep during the day.  I thought maybe a background noise would help.  I did a TON of research and review-reading before making this purchase.  I was concerned after reading the reviews about the lack of volume that has been claimed for this product, but have not found this to be an issue at all.  The volume levels are not too soft at all.  In fact, I often worry about it being too loud.  It has a great volume control to fit your needs.  We use the ocean sound, and at first I was worried because one wave sound is louder than the rest, but turning the volume down one notch solved this so it wasn't overbearing.The sounds are fantastic.  My husband likes to play with the blending of various sounds.  There is no break in the repeat of the noises and you cannot tell when the sound is starting its cycle over again, as I have read on so many other sound sleepers.  There is a HUGE variety of sounds as well.  I was impressed.  It has something that should match anyone's needs.It's a huge advantage to have the sound sleeper be battery operated or able to plug into a wall.  It's been a piece of cake to quickly unplug and use it on battery power when my son has fallen asleep in our bedroom or another location.  I love this feature.  We live overseas with the military, and when we vacation we can still take it with us to use on the batteries, since we can't use the plugs here without an adapter/transformer.We love the timer that is on the sound sleeper as well.  We usually let it run on \"on\" until my husband and I go to bed.  Then, when I am going into my son's room to check on him for the last time in the evening, I simply flip the button to timer and an hour later it goes off when we're all asleep.

My research involved going to all of the product websites, reading customer reviews, stopping people with various strollers on the street, talking with friends, and trying them each out in the stores. I had been borrowing an infant car-seat/snap-and-go combo from a friend for the first six months of my daughter's life and knew what I liked and didn't like about that stroller. In a city where your primary means of transportation is walking, a good-quality, durable stroller is critical --so you do need to spend a bit more money.After seriously evaluating the Evenflo Comfort system, the Graco Metrolite, the Combi TravelSavvy, the Maclaren Volo & Techno, the Bertini M5, the Peg Perego Pliko and this one, I had pretty much narrowed it down to the Peg Perego Venezia and the comparably priced and ubiquitous MacLaren Techno because they were the most durable and easiest to handle of the lot. The MacLaren is lighter and folds up smaller, but only marginally so, and I am forever spotting little sleeping childeren umcomfortably slumped forward in their MacLarens like coach class passengers on an overnight flight: the MacLaren's seats don't fully recline; and that is important when you are on long strolls/shopping trips that run into nap-time. Kids in MacLarens just look less comfortable and cozy than those in the Peg Perego. So after much backing and forthing, I took the chance on the Peg Perego. I'm really glad I did.I had a feeling I'd made a stellar choice as soon as I took it out of the box.  I was able to assemble it without even looking at the instructions: unlike so many items I've bought for my baby, it's operation was perfectly intuitive. It rides like a cadillac on the treacherous New York City sidewalks (pot holes, ice lumps, gravely streets, ramp-less curbs) and handles so well I can steer it with one hand --as easily as the MacLaren. It's not quite as small when folded, but it folds up so compactly into a standing position that it stays out of the way in our cramped NYC digs. It also has plenty of storage space in the lower basket that can be accessed while the seat is fully reclined (storage space is critical to the carless Manhattan resident) and it has much more of it than the MacLarens have. Note also that storage space was a deal-breaker with the Peg Perego Pliko, too: it is completely inaccessible from above --you have to slip items under a metal frame from the side. The Venezia's adjustable handle is nice and high so that you don't have to stoop to walk with it (I'm 5'7\"). It's as high as the one on the MacLaren Techno. I also love the bunting that allows it to be used as a cozy baby-carriage in the winter. Another cold-weather plus: the hood folds all the way down to to completely cover the baby in case of a sudden rain or windstorm. The Venezia fabric is by far the classiest and I've gotten many a compliment on it already. Sure, it would be nice to have a parent cup-holder, but the stroller handles so well  you can hold a cup in one hand and steer with the other --and it's probably a lot safer than having a cup of liquid positioned just over the baby's head. This is a great stroller, even for the price. I would recommend it to anyone, but especially to the City-dweller.2005 Edit to this review: This stroller was great until my daughter was 18 months old. After that, it became too cumbersome to steer with the extra weight. I bought a MacLaren Volo and have used that one since. I would still use this stroller if I had another baby, but only for the first year and a half.

At 6 months of age, my son really enjoys looking at the toys, passing them from one hand to the other, banging them together, and, of course, putting them in his mouth.

At 15 pounds, this stroller is easy to lift in and out of my trunk.  It is really easy to maneuver through tiny aisles.  The wheels are smooth and turn with ease.  The basket holds a lot of stuff.  It will hold a large bag (or even two), but I recommend placing the bag into the basket prior to setting the car seat on to the stroller.  I leave the bag open so i can access whatever I need after the car seat is in place (or you could use smaller bags and still pull them out from the back).  Note: this stroller is so lightweight that if your (heavy) diaper bag is hanging on the handles, without the car seat in place or other weight in the basket, the stroller may tip over.My only complaint is that the release button (which unlocks the stroller from it's collapsed position) sometimes gets stuck and I struggle to open it.  Sometimes the release button does not catch and I prefer it that way.  I'd honestly rather break the button because I don't think it is necessary to lock it in this position since it lays flat in my car anyway.I would definitely recommend this to anyone who doesn't mind purchasing a new stroller when the baby is ready to ride without the car seat.

It is not huge (which I like) and holds enough items for a day trip.  It has a side pocket for a bottle and the other pocket I use for pacifiers.

The inside has some pockets that I use for diapers.  It is large enough to hold a blankie, change of clothes, wipes, diapers & 2-3 bottles.  The strap is adjustable in length and it converts so you can hang it on the stroller handle(s).  It comes with a changing pad.I love the cord material and the color is also my favorite.

With baby two I have used this so much I can't believe I didn't the first time.  The trick is to adapt it.  I realise this isn't what most people want - more work with a newborn - but it is possible to create something that isn't out there on the market.I chopped off the tie on one side, sewed up the seam to match the other side, then sewed 2-way velcro around the neck hole.  It still works fine for discreet breastfeeding but with the stiffness of the velcro the neck sticks out a bit so you can see your baby handsfree.  Then it doubles (or quadruples) to hang over the top of a car seat, velcro-ing round the handle to black out/sunsheild; drap over a bassinet, velcro-ing up completely; or slipping over the handlebar of some double strollers to black out/sunsheild the baby in the back (I have a Phil n Teds), the loop at the bottom also happens to loop round a toggle on the stroller that stops it blowing up.  The fabric is such that it is lightweight but dense so it completely blacks out if your baby (as most babies do) sleeps longer in the dark or if you live in a sunny climate.

Separate canopies, accepts infant carseat, fully reclines, folds compactly, snack tray for each child, and it looks nice. When I ordered the stroller I wasn't sure I was going to like the seat adjustment straps.  I thought they were like bra straps (like a lot of Gracos have), but they are made like a drawstring instead...nice, easy to use.  Makes for a smoother transition for a sleeping child to be layed down. As for the roominess, My daughter doesn't have a ton of room like in her single stroller, but if I had been concerned with that I would have purchased a front/back double stroller, not a side-by-side. If they had a lot of room you would never fit through any doors and you would lose the compactness and lightness of the stroller (which in my opinion is the point of buying this stroller!) Folding and unfolding is a very easy process. Folded, it isn't much larger than my single peg perego pliko 3. I am impressed. The wheels are not made for tough terrain (I wouldn't recommend anything more than light, small gravel not deeply layered)  Best for trips to the mall, doctors office, strolls around town or the neighborhood on concrete surfaces. The baskets aren't huge, but there are two of them and if you've had a peg perego then you'll already be used to having a small basket...this one will seem like a dream because they are atleast easily accessible. If you use one diaper bag for two kids, I recommend purchasing a bag that has straps that you can unclip so that you can clip it to the handle bars. You can't hang anything from them and a large bag for two kids most likely will not fit in one of the baskets. I love the material on the stroller.  It not only looks nice, but feels really good too.  Kind of silky, but not cheap feeling...thick.  The canopies come way down to cover the baby's face and block the sun, they have a peekaboo window on each one, and a rather large air vent window which can be rolled up in the back.  The canopies even zip off for removal (although I'm not sure I'll ever need/want to remove them, it's good to know).  All in all this was the perfect stroller for us. The maclaren and inglesia look awesome too if both of your children are out of an infant carrier, but the combi definitely beats them out for those of us who like the convenience of using the infant carrier in their stroller.

We knew a few couples with the Diaper Genie, and one couple with the Diaper Champ. The couple with the Diaper Champ has a baby that is 3 months older than our child. This couple liked their Champ just fine, saying they noticed no odors. We also read tons of reviews, mainly here on Amazon, of both products. And from the reviews, it seemed there were many happy customers of both products. So we decided, if they were about equal, we would go with the more convenient and cheaper solution, the Champ.Well, we were pretty happy for about 4 to 6 months. We very much liked that we could use our regular trash bags. And changing the Champ's bag is very easy. But after our child was well into eating solids, at about 7 months, the smell became unbearable. It really is true that babies' poops really start to stink much, much worse when they eat lots of solids. So we went out and bought a Diaper Genie.  We have been using the Genie now for 2 months and very happy with the Genie. The Genie has 2 big advantages over the Champ, in regards to smell control. 1) Each diaper is contained in its own litte pouch via the Genie's twisting mechanism. 2) The filler bags progress in thickness, so as your child gets older, and her poops get smellier, you can get thicker, better bags.After using the Genie for about 2 months now, we are very pleased. The Champ is essentially a simple waste pail with a fancy hood. The hood and ordinary trash bags don't do much for odor prevention. The drawbacks to the Genie though, are that you must buy their fillers, and the bag changing mechanism is much more complicated than the Champ's. We thought these were worth dealing with to prevent the odors.": {"frequency": 1, "value": "We did alot of ..."}, "I love this booster seat i actually purchased 2 of them one for myself to always keep in my car for family visits and one for at my kids grandmothers.

I've never been a side sleeper and initially tried wedging normal pillows around me.  That didn't work so I eventually sought out this fabulous item.  It has literally made the difference between me being well rested or exhausted and uncomfortable all night long.  I was initially concerned because of the seam issue raised in a previous review.  However, when the pillow arrived, I found that although the seam might be uncomfortable, the issue was 100% resolved simply by placing a pillow on top of this one in the area where your head will go - thus covering the seam and eliminating any potential discomfort.  The pillow is large - if you have anything smaller than a queen sized bed you or your partner might need a new place to snooze, however, the size is what makes it comfortable.  At night I can roll over without having to relocate anything but myself.  Since it wraps around, it mostly prevents accidentally sleeping on my stomach or back which could be harmful to baby and it's substantive without being too big to be cuddly as the person inside it.

The only time that you even smell an odor is when you open it to put in another diaper.  But, let's be honest, don't you smell an odor when you put something in the trash can too?  You can't really expect to smell nothing when you open any diaper disposal system!

Also, the disposal of the diapers into a trash can is very easy.  All you have to do is hold down the scissor button and turn the knob until the scissor button pops up.  Open the bottom and dump them out.  No mess, no worrying about dropping diapers anywhere.  The only thing about this is that sometimes it does not cut the film all the way, so I would check it before you decide to dump out all the diapers.  I usually just cut it with scissors if it did not cut all the way.  The only real downside that I have seen to the Diaper Genie so far is that the refills are pretty expensive.

Once you re-install safety latches, you find all over again just how annoying it is to open a cabinet or drawer only to have it come to a sudden stop and you think - &#34;Oh, yeah.

I have theThirsties 6 Pack Fab Wipes, Boy, the Imported Flannel Wipes 15 pack - All unbleached, and some two sided 100% cotton terry cloth wipes from Green Mountain Diapers. In my opinion they all have pros and cons it really just depends what you are looking for.The Thirsties are by far the softest, even after washing in our very hard water. After a couple months the colors have stayed well and they are the cutest. I like the two sides, the longer side is great for getting bulk and the other side is very soft and gets anything that's left behind. They are the largest but fit ok (about 12) in my Prince Lionhart warmer if they are folded in half. They do kind of stick together so pulling one out one handed is more difficult. If you want something really soft and cute, go with these.The flannel wipes are the most cost-effective option. They are thin and sometimes require a little bit more scrubbing to get sticky messes clean. They are pretty soft also. The best thing about this is you don't have to worry about running out of wipes in the middle of a diaper change. You can fit at least 30 wipes folded in half in a warmer. They are also wash cloth size so they cover your hand well and I like that I don't have to worry about using too many wipes. So if you're looking for cost effective and ease of use I would go with these.The 100% cotton wipes are nice because they clean messes really well and they are fit to go into a warmer, so I don't have to do any fancy acrobatics to unfold anything. These are the least soft of the 3 and even though they aren't folded they take up a lot of room in the warmer and don't fit perfectly (the edges come up). They say they are two sided but I don't like using the smooth side at all, it doesn't seem to have much use to me. They are also smaller and so I usually have to use more and I end up with stuff on my hands more often than with the others. If you like 100% cotton these would be an ok choice but honestly I would probably go with Under The Nile Organic Cotton Baby Wipes - 6 Pack which sound like they're softer.": {"frequency": 1, "value": "I am one of those ..."}, "I bought this pump to use in the morning when I have a lot of milk and only feed the baby on one side and pump the other.

It takes up the same amount of room that a normal single travel system would take up.For all you shoppers out there.

If it was affordable I would buy one this instant. (It's definitely worth the money if you have the ability to pay.)My reflexologist put me on the Medi-Rub machine to get me warmed up for my treatment. She didn't do that for my first appointment and I could tell the difference. It really got my circulation going big-time. The reflexology treatment then seemed to \"follow\" the increased circulation up my legs and into my pelvis. It also increased the relaxation aspect of the treatment considerably.I use a wooden footsie roller at home for a general tonic effect on my feet (a quick, non-specific burst of reflexology is what I'm looking for during my busy schedule). This now seems like a caveman tool. I thought the roller effect was pretty darn wonderful until I experienced the Medi-Rub Foot Massager. Even on \"low\" (there are only two speeds - high and low) this machine puts my humble footsie roller in the shade within 15 seconds when it comes to sheer stimulation.The Medi-Rub is also more comfortable and less awkward. I can sit back in an armchair and allow the tilt of the footpad to support me, instead of perching on the edge of a chair and running in place on the rollers. The \"running in place\" action makes my back ache, whereas the Medi-Rub Massager doesn't require a straining posture of any kind. You don't have to do anything but close your eyes and let the bliss happen.This is an excellent therapeutic device, but it's also a superb way to get completely relaxed in the space of a few minutes.

I have had to make sure the nipple is in tight a couple of times or nothing came out. BUT the main fix for not getting milk fast enough is (like many reviews I was about to give up on these bottles) not letting your baby take the nipple to the base of the bottle.

Anyway, the one thing I really liked about this seat is that the cover is washable. However for some reason, their newer car seats' covers are only hand washable, which I feel is a very bad move; a great disservice. If baby's diaper leaks or baby spits up/vomits, you want to stick it in the washer and dryer and get it over with.  Now we're forced to spend $40 to $60 for a backup cover. Good move for Britax's bottom line, but not ours.  The other problem we had is that it did tip, but I think that was more from my hubby not installing it correctly, although it should really be idiot proof.  One day we were driving down a mountain and ds was wild, rocking his seat back and forth.  We heard \"Uh oh\" coming from the back seat and found he was laying on his side in the seat. Hubby tethered it then and stopped the problem. DS is now almost six years old and says it's still comfortable. I wish their seats had footrests. He could put his food up on the bottom rung of the seat, which I don't think the newer seats have.  We were going to move my 6 mo. old dd into his seat, but were advised that you should not use seats that are over 6 years old, as the straps, plastic and foam break down, along with it being old technology. We went ahead and bought the huge Marathon instead because it will go up to 65lb, not 40 like the new Roundabouts.  Our next move is to get a new seat for our six year old, which will probably be the Britax booster seats.

It's better than I thought it would be when I saw it online!  What attracted me to the stroller initially was that the seat had a 5 point harness, a seat in the back for my 3 year old to sit or stand, a storage basket underneath and a snack/drink tray for the youngest in the front.  My in-laws gave this to my husband and myself as a gift (we're expecting baby #3 any day now)!  Once the stroller was here and we put it together which by the way took only 5 minutes and I was able to do it myself it had soooo many more features than I had expected.  There's a nice little mesh bag on the back of the front seat and the height handle of the bar is perfect (most stroller bars are so low you actually are hunched over to push the stroller), and BEST of all is that there is a seat belt on the back seat so that the oldest child can still be buckled in (great when you have a wild child like mine!).  The back seat has PLENTY of room even with the infant car seat on the front (which by the way we did not have to reclline the front seat to make that happen as another reviewer has said).  It folds easily, steers BEAUTIFULLY, and is as compact as a single stroller (though a little bit longer).  The FEW improvements it could use is that the storage basket underneath is rather small and could be difficult to get to, it would be nice to have a drink holder for mom and dad (keys, wallets, ect. can go in that small mesh bag on the back of the seat) but drink holders can be picked up most anywhere, and the front seat does not recline very far at all (but most kids when tired can fall asleep most anywhere although it can't really be used with an infant unless they're in an infant carier to recline in), it would also be nice if there was some sort of locking mechanism to keep the back bench from sliding  But these issues are very minor for us.  I had a baby trend sit and stand for my now 7 year old and 3 year old when the 3 year old was born and hardly ever used it, I hated it.  The baby trend sit and stand did not fold down well, did not have a seat belt on the back seat to keep my then 4 year old seated, did not have a 5 point harness or a snack/drink tray in the front for baby, and did not have as much space in the back for the older child, it also diid not have that locking mechanism for the back bench, the universal car seat attachment was more difficult to use than the one that comes with the JOOVY so we simply never bothered with it .  The one plus that it DID have that the Joovy does not is that the front seat reclined quite far (but of course then there was no room in the back whatsoever).  I prefer the Joovy by far and my 3 year old son absolutely loves it as well, he thinks he's such a big boy riding in the back!": {"frequency": 1, "value": "This stroller has ..."}, "I am very satisfied with the quality of the frame.

She is very attracted to light anyway, and this seems to soothe and calm her at the end of the day. She's also fascinated by my husband waving his fingers over the turtle's body to create \"clouds\" passing over the stars. Because she loves it so much, my husband and I are pretty fond of it, too.The turtle itself is kinda cute but my mom was hesitant about giving us the \"military\" colored one. I think it's a nice neutral and prefer it to the turquoise.The batteries are behind screws, which makes them more difficult to change but keeps them away from little prying fingers.One set of batteries, the set that came with it, lasted us about three months with almost-daily use. Battery life can be extended by using the on/off switch on the back between uses (we did not).I will keep this in mind for future baby presents - it would be a nice change from the typical onesie.": {"frequency": 2, "value": "I clicked five ..."}, "I have my daughter every other weekend.

I put this on my Baby Registry, and received it as a gift at one of my showers.  My daughter was born 6 weeks early, so she was quite tiny when I put her in the carrier the first time.  She was so small that her eye level was where the arm holes are!  Regardless, she would quiet down when she was put in it.  Now she &quot;fits&quot; in it correctly, and she absolutely loves it.  I use it all the time....-I use it when I go shopping.  It leaves my hands free, and my daughter perfers it over being in a carrier.-I use it at home especially if I am trying to get house work done, and she's a bit fussy.  I can put her in the carrier, and she quiets down almost immediately.  I can vaccum, do dishes, dust, all kinds of things, and she's so content.-I use it when we (baby, rottie, and myself) go walking.  It's easier to have her in the carrier than trying to push a stroller and handle a rottie at the same time.-I use it just to calm her down.  When she's fussing, I put her in the carrier, and she just calms down.A great feature of the carrier is that if your baby falls asleep in the carrier, you can undo the carrier without waking the baby up!So, if you're shopping for a gift, and you want to be remembered ever time the gift is used, buy this carrier.

<p>Now we proceed with <em>Step 2</em>. For each word in <strong>impWrds</strong>, we compute a count for the number of times the word occurs in the review. We will store this count in a separate column (one for each word). The result of this feature processing is a single column for each word in <strong>impWrds</strong> which keeps a count of the number of times the respective word occurs in the review text.</p>
<p><strong>Note:</strong> There are several ways of doing this. In this assignment, we use the built-in <em>count</em> function for Python lists. Each review string is first split into individual words and the number of occurances of a given word is counted.</p>

<p><strong>Aside</strong>. How the link function works with matrix algebra</p>
<p>Since the word counts are stored as columns in <strong>glbObsAllFtrMtrx</strong>, each $i$-th row of the matrix corresponds to the feature vector $h(\mathbf{x}_i)$:
$$
[\text{glbObsAllFtrMtrx}] =
\left[
\begin{array}{c}
h(\mathbf{x}_1)^T \\
h(\mathbf{x}_2)^T \\
\vdots \\
h(\mathbf{x}_N)^T
\end{array}
\right] =
\left[
\begin{array}{cccc}
h_0(\mathbf{x}_1) & h_1(\mathbf{x}_1) & \cdots & h_D(\mathbf{x}_1) \\
h_0(\mathbf{x}_2) & h_1(\mathbf{x}_2) & \cdots & h_D(\mathbf{x}_2) \\
\vdots & \vdots & \ddots & \vdots \\
h_0(\mathbf{x}_N) & h_1(\mathbf{x}_N) & \cdots & h_D(\mathbf{x}_N)
\end{array}
\right]
$$</p>
<p>By the rules of matrix multiplication, the score vector containing elements $\mathbf{w}^T h(\mathbf{x}_i)$ is obtained by multiplying <strong>glbObsAllFtrMtrx</strong> and the coefficient vector $\mathbf{w}$.
$$
[\text{score}] =
[\text{glbObsAllFtrMtrx}]\mathbf{w} =
\left[
\begin{array}{c}
h(\mathbf{x}_1)^T \\
h(\mathbf{x}_2)^T \\

<p>In the main lecture, our focus was on the likelihood.  In the advanced optional video, however, we introduced a transformation of this likelihood---called the log likelihood---that simplifies the derivation of the gradient and is more numerically stable.  Due to its numerical stability, we will use the log likelihood instead of the likelihood to assess the algorithm.</p>
<p>The log likelihood is computed using the following formula (see the advanced optional video if you are curious about the derivation of this equation):</p>
$$\ell\ell(\mathbf{w}) = \sum_{i=1}^N \Big( (\mathbf{1}[y_i = +1] - 1)\mathbf{w}^T h(\mathbf{x}_i) - \ln\left(1 + \exp(-\mathbf{w}^T h(\mathbf{x}_i))\right) \Big) $$<p>We provide a function to compute the log likelihood for the entire dataset.</p>

<p>Recall from lecture that class predictions for a data point $\mathbf{x}$ can be computed from the coefficients $\mathbf{w}$ using the following formula:
$$
\hat{y}_i = 
\left\{
\begin{array}{ll}
      +1 & \mathbf{x}_i^T\mathbf{w} > 0 \\
      -1 & \mathbf{x}_i^T\mathbf{w} \leq 0 \\
\end{array} 
\right.
$$</p>
<p>Now, we will write some code to compute class predictions. We will do this in two steps:</p>
<ul>
<li><strong>Step 1</strong>: First compute the <strong>scores</strong> using <strong>glbObsAllFtrMtrx</strong> and <strong>coefficients</strong> using a dot product.</li>
<li><strong>Step 2</strong>: Using the formula above, compute the class predictions from the scores.</li>
</ul>
<p>Step 1 can be implemented as follows:</p>
