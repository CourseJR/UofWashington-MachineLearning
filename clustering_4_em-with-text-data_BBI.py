# ## Fitting a diagonal covariance Gaussian mixture model to text data
# 
# In a previous assignment, we explored k-means clustering for a high-dimensional Wikipedia dataset. We can also model this data with a mixture of Gaussians, though with increasing dimension we run into two important issues associated with using a full covariance matrix for each component.
#  * Computational cost becomes prohibitive in high dimensions: score calculations have complexity cubic in the number of dimensions M if the Gaussian has a full covariance matrix.
#  * A model with many parameters require more data: bserve that a full covariance matrix for an M-dimensional Gaussian will have M(M+1)/2 parameters to fit. With the number of parameters growing roughly as the square of the dimension, it may quickly become impossible to find a sufficient amount of data to make good inferences.
# 
# Both of these issues are avoided if we require the covariance matrix of each component to be diagonal, as then it has only M parameters to fit and the score computation decomposes into M univariate score calculations. Recall from the lecture that the M-step for the full covariance is:
# 
# \begin{align*}
# \hat{\Sigma}_k &= \frac{1}{N_k^{soft}} \sum_{i=1}^N r_{ik} (x_i-\hat{\mu}_k)(x_i - \hat{\mu}_k)^T
# \end{align*}
# 
# Note that this is a square matrix with M rows and M columns, and the above equation implies that the (v, w) element is computed by
# 
# \begin{align*}
# \hat{\Sigma}_{k, v, w} &= \frac{1}{N_k^{soft}} \sum_{i=1}^N r_{ik} (x_{iv}-\hat{\mu}_{kv})(x_{iw} - \hat{\mu}_{kw})
# \end{align*}
# 
# When we assume that this is a diagonal matrix, then non-diagonal elements are assumed to be zero and we only need to compute each of the M elements along the diagonal independently using the following equation. 
# 
# \begin{align*}
# \hat{\sigma}^2_{k, v} &= \hat{\Sigma}_{k, v, v}  \\
# &= \frac{1}{N_k^{soft}} \sum_{i=1}^N r_{ik} (x_{iv}-\hat{\mu}_{kv})^2
# \end{align*}
# 
# In this section, we will use an EM implementation to fit a Gaussian mixture model with **diagonal** covariances to a subset of the Wikipedia dataset. The implementation uses the above equation to compute each variance term. 
# 
# We'll begin by importing the dataset and coming up with a useful representation for each article. After running our algorithm on the data, we will explore the output to see whether we can give a meaningful interpretation to the fitted parameters in our model.

# ## Import necessary packages

# The following code block will check if you have the correct version of GraphLab Create. Any version later than 1.8.5 will do. To upgrade, read [this page](https://turi.com/download/upgrade-graphlab-create.html).

# In[20]:

import graphlab as gl
print('gl.version: %s' % (gl.version))
gl.canvas.set_target('ipynb')

# We also have a Python file containing implementations for several functions that will be used during the course of this assignment.

# ## Load Wikipedia data and extract TF-IDF features

# Load Wikipedia data and transform each of the first 5000 document into a TF-IDF representation.

# In[22]:

wiki = gl.SFrame('data/people_wiki.gl/').head(5000)
wiki['tf_idf'] = gl.text_analytics.tf_idf(wiki['text'])


# Using a utility we provide, we will create a sparse matrix representation of the documents. This is the same utility function you used during the previous assignment on k-means with text data.

# In[23]:

tf_idf, map_index_to_word = sframe_to_scipy(wiki, 'tf_idf')


# As in the previous assignment, we will normalize each document's TF-IDF vector to be a unit vector. 

# In[24]:

tf_idf = normalize(tf_idf)


# We can check that the length (Euclidean norm) of each row is now 1.0, as expected.

# In[25]:

for i in range(5):
    doc = tf_idf[i]
    print(np.linalg.norm(doc.todense()))


# ## EM in high dimensions
# 
# EM for high-dimensional data requires some special treatment:
#  * E step and M step must be vectorized as much as possible, as explicit loops are dreadfully slow in Python.
#  * All operations must be cast in terms of sparse matrix operations, to take advantage of computational savings enabled by sparsity of data.
#  * Initially, some words may be entirely absent from a cluster, causing the M step to produce zero mean and variance for those words.  This means any data point with one of those words will have 0 probability of being assigned to that cluster since the cluster allows for no variability (0 variance) around that count being 0 (0 mean). Since there is a small chance for those words to later appear in the cluster, we instead assign a small positive variance (~1e-10). Doing so also prevents numerical overflow.
#  
# We provide the complete implementation for you in the file `em_utilities.py`. For those who are interested, you can read through the code to see how the sparse matrix implementation differs from the previous assignment. 
# 
# You are expected to answer some quiz questions using the results of clustering.

# **Initializing mean parameters using k-means**
# 
# Recall from the lectures that EM for Gaussian mixtures is very sensitive to the choice of initial means. With a bad initial set of means, EM may produce clusters that span a large area and are mostly overlapping. To eliminate such bad outcomes, we first produce a suitable set of initial means by using the cluster centers from running k-means.  That is, we first run k-means and then take the final set of means from the converged solution as the initial means in our EM algorithm.

# In[26]:

from sklearn.cluster import KMeans

np.random.seed(5)
num_clusters = 25

# Use scikit-learn's k-means to simplify workflow
kmeans_model = KMeans(n_clusters=num_clusters, n_init=5, max_iter=400, random_state=1, n_jobs=-1)
kmeans_model.fit(tf_idf)
centroids, cluster_assignment = kmeans_model.cluster_centers_, kmeans_model.labels_

means = [centroid for centroid in centroids]

# **Initializing cluster weights**
# 
# We will initialize each cluster weight to be the proportion of documents assigned to that cluster by k-means above.

# In[28]:

num_docs = tf_idf.shape[0]
weights = []
for i in xrange(num_clusters):
    # Compute the number of data points assigned to cluster i:
    num_assigned = np.sum(cluster_assignment == i) # YOUR CODE HERE
    w = float(num_assigned) / num_docs
    weights.append(w)
    
print "weights: "; print (weights)
assert sum(weights) == 1.0


# **Initializing covariances**
# 
# To initialize our covariance parameters, we compute $\hat{\sigma}_{k, j}^2 = \sum_{i=1}^{N}(x_{i,j} - \hat{\mu}_{k, j})^2$ for each feature $j$.  For features with really tiny variances, we assign 1e-8 instead to prevent numerical instability. We do this computation in a vectorized fashion in the following code block.

# In[29]:

covs = []
for i in xrange(num_clusters):
    member_rows = tf_idf[cluster_assignment==i]
    cov = (member_rows.power(2) - 2*member_rows.dot(diag(means[i]))).sum(axis=0).A1 /             member_rows.shape[0]           + means[i]**2
    cov[cov < 1e-8] = 1e-8
    covs.append(cov)
    
print "covs: "; print (covs)    
print "sum(covs): "; print (sum(covs))    


# **Running EM**
# 
# Now that we have initialized all of our parameters, run EM.

# In[30]:

out = EM_for_high_dimension(tf_idf, means, covs, weights, cov_smoothing=1e-10)


# In[31]:

out['loglik']


# ## Interpret clustering results

# In contrast to k-means, EM is able to explicitly model clusters of varying sizes and proportions. The relative magnitude of variances in the word dimensions tell us much about the nature of the clusters.
# 
# Write yourself a cluster visualizer as follows.  Examining each cluster's mean vector, list the 5 words with the largest mean values (5 most common words in the cluster). For each word, also include the associated variance parameter (diagonal element of the covariance matrix). 
# 
# A sample output may be:
# ```
# ==========================================================
# Cluster 0: Largest mean parameters in cluster 
# 
# Word        Mean        Variance    
# football    1.08e-01    8.64e-03

num_clusters = len(means)
num_docs, num_words = tf_idf.shape

random_means = []
random_covs = []
random_weights = []

for k in range(num_clusters):
    
    # Create a numpy array of length num_words with random normally distributed values.
    # Use the standard univariate normal distribution (mean 0, variance 1).
    # YOUR CODE HERE
    mean = np.random.normal(loc = 0.0, scale = 1.0, size = num_words)
    
    # Create a numpy array of length num_words with random values uniformly distributed 
    #   between 1 and 5.
    # YOUR CODE HERE
    cov = np.random.uniform(low = 1.0, high = 5.0, size = num_words)

    # Initially give each cluster equal weight.
    # YOUR CODE HERE
    weight = 1.0 / num_clusters
    
    random_means.append(mean)
    random_covs.append(cov)
    random_weights.append(weight)


# **Quiz Question**: Try fitting EM with the random initial parameters you created above. (Use `cov_smoothing=1e-5`.) Store the result to `out_random_init`. What is the final loglikelihood that the algorithm converges to? 

# In[38]:

out_random_init = EM_for_high_dimension(tf_idf, means, covs, weights, cov_smoothing=1e-5)
print out_random_init['loglik']


# **Quiz Question:** Is the final loglikelihood larger or smaller than the final loglikelihood we obtained above when initializing EM with the results from running k-means?

# In[40]:

print out_random_init['loglik'][-1] - out['loglik'][-1]


# **Quiz Question**: For the above model, `out_random_init`, use the `visualize_EM_clusters` method you created above. Are the clusters more or less interpretable than the ones found after initializing using k-means?

# In[41]:

# YOUR CODE HERE. Use visualize_EM_clusters, which will require you to pass in 
#   tf_idf and map_index_to_word.
visualize_EM_clusters(tf_idf, out_random_init['means'], out_random_init['covs'], 
                      map_index_to_word)


# **Note**: Random initialization may sometimes produce a superior fit than k-means initialization. We do not claim that random initialization is always worse. However, this section does illustrate that random initialization often produces much worse clustering than k-means counterpart. This is the reason why we provide the particular random seed (`np.random.seed(5)`).

# ## Takeaway
# 
# In this assignment we were able to apply the EM algorithm to a mixture of Gaussians model of text data. This was made possible by modifying the model to assume a diagonal covariance for each cluster, and by modifying the implementation to use a sparse matrix representation. In the second part you explored the role of k-means initialization on the convergence of the model as well as the interpretability of the clusters.
